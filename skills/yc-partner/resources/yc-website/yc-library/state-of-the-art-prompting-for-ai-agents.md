## Transcript

Host: Metaprompting is turning out to be a very, very powerful tool that everyone's using now. It
kind of actually feels like coding in, you know, 1995. Like, the tools are not all the way there.
We're, you know, in this new frontier. But personally, it also kind of feels like learning how to
manage a person, where it's like, how do I actually communicate, you know, the things that they need
to know in order to make a good decision. Welcome back to another episode of the Light Cone. Today
we're pulling back the curtain on what is actually happening inside the best AI startups when it
comes to prompt engineering. We surveyed more than a dozen companies and got their take right from
the frontier of building this stuff—the practical tips.

Jared Friedman: Jared, why don't we start with an example from one of your best AI startups? I
managed to get an example from a company called Parahelp. Parahelp does AI customer support. There
are a bunch of companies who are doing this, but Parahelp is doing it really, really well. They're
actually powering the customer support for Perplexity and Replit and Bolt and a bunch of other like
top AI companies now. So if you go and you email a customer support ticket into Perplexity, what's
actually responding is like their AI agent. The cool thing is that the Parahelp guys very graciously
agreed to show us the actual prompt that is powering this agent, and to put it on screen on YouTube
for the entire world to see. It's like relatively hard to get these prompts for vertical AI agents
because they're kind of like the crown jewels of the IP of these companies, and so very grateful to
the Parahelp guys for agreeing to basically like open source this prompt.

Diana Hu: Diana, can you walk us through this very detailed prompt? It's super interesting and it's
very rare to get a chance to see this in action. So the interesting thing about this prompt is
actually first, it's really long. It's very detailed in this document you can see is like six pages
long just scrolling through it. The big thing that a lot of the best prompts start with is this
concept of setting up the role of the LLM. You're a manager of a customer service agent, and it
breaks down into bullet points what it needs to do. Then the big thing is telling the task, which is
to approve or reject a tool call, because it's orchestrating agent calls from all these other ones.
And then it gives it a bit of the high-level plan. It breaks it down step by step. You see steps
one, two, three, four, five. And then it gives some of the important things to keep in mind—that it
should not kind of go weird into calling different kinds of tools. It tells them how to structure
the output, because a lot of things with agents is you need them to integrate with other agents. So
almost like gluing the API call. So it is important to specify that it's going to give certain
output of accepting or rejecting and in this format. Then this is sort of the high-level section,
and one thing that the best prompts do—they break it down sort of in this markdown type of style
formatting. So you have sort of the heading here, and then later on it goes into more details on how
to do the planning, and you see this is like a sub-bullet part of it. And as part of the plan,
there's actually three big sections: how to plan and then how to create each of the steps in the
plan and then the high-level example of the plan. One big thing about the best prompts is they
outline how to reason about the task, and then a big thing is giving it an example. And this is what
it does. And one thing that's interesting about this is it looks more like programming than writing
English, because it has this XML tag kind of format to specify sort of the plan. We found that it
makes a lot easier for LLMs to follow, because a lot of LLMs were post-trained in RLHF with kind of
XML type of input, and it turns out to produce better results.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, one thing I'm surprised that isn't in here, or maybe this is just the version
that they released—what I almost expect is there to be a section where it describes a particular
scenario and actually gives example output for that scenario.

Diana Hu: That's in like the next stage of the pipeline.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, oh really? Okay.

Diana Hu: Yeah, because it's customer specific, right? Because like every customer has their own
like flavor of how to respond to these support tickets. And so their challenge—like a lot of these
agent companies—is like how do you build a general purpose product when every customer like wants,
you know, has like slightly different workflows and like preferences.

Jared Friedman: Has a really interesting thing that I see the vertical AI agent companies talking
about a lot, which is like how do you have enough flexibility to make special purpose logic without
turning into a consulting company where you're building like a new prompt for every customer. I
actually think this concept of forking and merging prompts across customers, and which part of the
prompt is customer specific versus like company-wide, is like a really interesting thing that the
world is only just beginning to explore.

Diana Hu: Yeah, that's a very good point, Jared. So this is concept of defining the prompt in the
system prompt. Then there's a developer prompt, and then there's a user prompt. So what this means
is the system prompt is basically almost like defining sort of the high-level API of how your
company operates. In this case, the example of Parahelp is very much a system prompt. There's
nothing specific about the customer. And then as they add specific instances of that API and calling
it, then they stuff all that into more the developer prompt, which is not shown here, and that adds
all the context of, let's say, working with Perplexity—there's certain ways of how you handle RAG
questions as opposed to working with Bolt, which is very different, right? And then I don't think
Parahelp has a user prompt, because their product is not consumed directly by an end user, but an
end user prompt could be more like Replit or a Zerocode right, where users need to type like,
"generate me a site that has these buttons, this and that," and that goes all in the user prompt. So
that's sort of the architecture that's sort of emerging. And to your point about avoiding becoming a
consulting company, I think there's so many startup opportunities in building the tooling around all
of this stuff. Like, for example, anyone who's done prompt engineering knows that the examples and
worked examples are really important to improving the quality of the output. And so then if you take
Parahelp as an example, they really want good worked examples that are specific to each company. And
so you can imagine that as they scale, you almost want that done automatically. Like, in your dream
world, what you want is just like an agent itself that can pluck out the best examples from like the
customer data set and then software that just like ingests that straight into like wherever it
should belong in the pipeline without you having to manually go out and plug that all in and ingest
it in all of yourself.

Host: That's probably a great segue into metaprompting, which is one of the things we want to talk
about, because that's a consistent theme that keeps coming up when we talk to our AI startups.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, Tropier is one of the startups I'm working with in the current YC batch, and
they've really helped people like YC company Ducky do really in-depth understanding and debugging of
the prompts and the return values from a multi-stage workflow. And one of the things they figured
out is prompt folding. So, basically, one prompt can dynamically generate better versions of itself.
So a good example of that is a classifier prompt that generates a specialized prompt based on the
previous query. And so you can actually go in, take the existing prompt that you have, and actually
feed it more examples where maybe the prompt failed or didn't quite do what you wanted, and you can
actually, instead of you having to go and rewrite the prompt, you just put it into the raw LLM and
say, "Help me make this prompt better." And because it knows itself so well, strangely,
metaprompting is turning out to be a very, very powerful tool that everyone's using now. And the
next step after you do sort of prompt folding—if the task is very complex—there's this concept of
using examples. And this is what Jasberry does. It's one of the companies I'm working with this
batch. They basically build automatic bug finding in code, which is a lot harder. And the way they
do it is they feed a bunch of really hard examples that only expert programmers could do. Let's say
if you want to find an N plus one query, it's actually hard for today, even for the best LLMs to
find those. And the way to do those is they find parts of the code, then they add those into the
prompt—a meta prompt that's like, "Hey, this is an example of an N plus one type of error," and then
that works it out. And I think this pattern of sometimes when it's too hard to even kind of write a
prompt around it, let's just give you an example that turns out to work really well, because it
helps LLMs to reason around complicated tasks and steer it better, because you can't quite kind of
put exact parameters, and it's almost like unit testing programming in a sense. Like test-driven
development is sort of the LLM version of that.

Host: Yeah, another thing that Tropier sort of talks about is, you know, the model really wants to
actually help you so much that if you just tell it, "Give me back output in this particular format,"
even if it doesn't quite have the information it needs, it'll actually just tell you what it thinks
you want to hear, and it's literally a hallucination. So one thing they discovered is that you
actually have to give the LLMs a real escape hatch. You need to tell it, "If you do not have enough
information to say yes or no or make a determination, don't just make it up. Stop and ask me." And
that's a very different way to think about it. That's actually something we learned at some of the
internal work that we've done with agents at YC, where Jared came up with a really inventive way to
give the LLM escape hatch. Did you want to talk about that?

Jared Friedman: Yeah, so the Tropier approach is one way to give the LLM an escape hatch. We came up
with a different way, which is in the response format to give it the ability to have part of the
response be essentially a complaint to you, the developer, that like you have given it confusing or
underspecified information and it doesn't know what to do. And then the nice thing about that is
that we just run your LLM like in production with real user data, and then you can go back and you
can look at the outputs that it has given you in that output parameter. We call it debug info
internally. So like we have this debug info parameter where it's basically reporting to us things
that we need to fix about it, and it literally ends up being like a to-do list that you, the agent
developer, has to do. It's like really kind of mind-blowing stuff.

Host: Yeah, yeah, I mean just even for hobbyists or people who are interested in playing around with
this for personal projects, like a very simple way to get started with metaprompting is to follow
the same structure of the prompt—give it a role and make the role be like, you know, "You're an
expert prompt engineer who gives really detailed, great critiques and advice on how to improve
prompts," and give it the prompt that you had in mind and it will spit you back a much more
expanded, better prompt, and so you can just keep running that loop for a while. Works surprisingly
well. I think it's a common pattern sometimes for companies when they need to get responses from
elements in their product a lot quicker. They do the metaprompting with a bigger, beefier model, any
of the, I don't know, hundreds of billions of parameter plus models like, uh, I guess Claude 3.5 or
your GPT-4o, and they do this metaprompting, and then they have a very good working one that then
they use in the distilled model. So they use it on, uh, for example, Llama, and it ends up working
pretty well. Specifically, sometimes for voice AI agent companies, because latency is very important
to get this whole Turing test to pass, because if you have too much pause before the agent responds,
I think humans can detect something is off. So they use a faster model but with a bigger, better
prompt that was refined from the bigger models. So that's like a common pattern as well. Another,
again, less sophisticated, maybe, but like as the prompt gets longer and longer, like it becomes a
large working doc. One thing I found useful is as you're using it, if you just note down in a Google
Doc things that you're seeing—just the outputs not being how you want or ways that you can think of
to improve it—you can just write those in note form and then give Gemini Pro like your notes plus
the original prompt and ask it to suggest a bunch of edits to the prompt to incorporate these in
well, and it does that quite well. The other trick is in Gemini 2.5 Pro—if you look at the thinking
traces as it's parsing through evaluation, you could actually learn a lot about all those misses as
well. We've done that internally as well, right? As this is critical, because if you're just using
Gemini via the API, until recently, you did not get the thinking traces, and like the thinking
traces are like the critical debug information to understand like what's wrong with your prompt.
They just added it to the API, so you can now actually like pipe that back into your developer tools
and workflows.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, I think it's an underrated consequence of Gemini Pro having such long context
windows is you can effectively use it like a REPL, go sort of like one by one, like put your prompt
on, like one example, then literally watch the reasoning trace in real time to figure out like how
you can steer it in the direction you want. Jared and the software team at YC has actually built
various forms of workbenches that allow us to like debug and things like that. But to your point,
like sometimes it's better just to use gemini.google.com directly and then drag and drop, you know,
literally JSON files, and uh, you know, you don't have to do it in some sort of special container.
Like, it seems to be totally something that works even directly in, you know, ChatGPT itself.

Host: Yeah, this is all stuff. Um, I would give a shout out to YC's head of data, Eric Bacon, who's
helped us a lot with a lot of this metaprompting and using Gemini Pro 2.5 as effectively a REPL.
What about evals? I mean, we've talked about evals for going on a year now. Um, what are some of the
things that founders are discovering?

Gary Tan: Even though we've been saying this for a year or more now, Gary, I think it's still the
case that like evals are the true crown jewel—like data asset for all of these companies. Like one
reason that Parahelp was willing to open source the prompt is they told me that they actually don't
consider the prompts to be the crown jewels—like the evals are the crown jewels, because without the
evals, you don't know why the prompt was written the way that it was. Um, and it's very hard to
improve it.

Host: Yeah, and I think in abstraction, you can think about, you know, YC funds a lot of companies,
especially in vertical AI and SaaS, and then you can't get the eval unless you're sitting literally
side by side with people who are doing X, Y, or Z knowledge work. You know, you need to sit next to
the tractor sales regional manager and understand, well, you know, this person cares, you know, this
is how they get promoted. This is what they care about. This is that person's reward function. And
then, you know, what you're doing is taking these in-person interactions sitting next—

Host: To someone in Nebraska and then going back to your computer and codifying it into very
specific evals. Like, "This particular user wants this outcome after they, you know, after this
invoice comes in. We have to decide whether we're going to honor the warranty on this tractor."
Like, just to take one example, that's the true value, right? Like, everyone's really worried about,
um, are we just wrappers and, you know, what is going to happen to startups? And I think this is
literally where the rubber meets the road. Where if you, you know, if you are out there in
particular places understanding that user better than anyone else and having the software actually
work for those people, that's the moat.

Host: That is like such a perfect depiction of, like, what is the core competency required of
founders today? Like, literally, the thing that you just said, like, that's your job as a founder of
a company like this. You have to be really good at that thing and maniacally obsessed with the
details of the regional tractor sales manager workflow.

Audience Member: Yeah. And then the wild thing is it's very hard to do. You know, have you even been
to Nebraska?

Host: You know, the classic view is that the best founders in the world, they're sort of really
great cracked engineers and technologists and just really brilliant. And at the same time, they have
to understand some part of the world that very few people understand. And then there's this little
sliver that is, you know, the founder of a multi-billion dollar startup. You know, I think of Ryan
Peterson from Flexport, you know, really, really great person who understands how software is built,
but then also I think he was the third biggest importer of medical hot tubs for an entire year,
like, you know, a decade ago. So, you know, the weirder that is, the more of the world that you've
seen that nobody else who's a technologist has seen, the greater the opportunity actually.

Host: I think you've put this in a really interesting way before, Gary, where you're sort of saying
that every founder's become a forward deployed engineer. That's like a term that traces back to
Palantir. And since you were early at Palantir, maybe tell us a little bit about how did forward
deployed engineer become a thing at Palantir and what can founders learn from it now?

Gary Tan: I mean, I think the whole thesis of Palantir at some level was that if you look at
Meta—back then it was called Facebook—or Google or any of the top software startups that everyone
sort of knew back then. One of the key recognitions that Peter Thiel and Alex Karp and Stefan Cohen
and Joe Lansdale, Nathan Gettings, like the original founders of Palantir had was that go into
anywhere in the Fortune 500, go into any government agency in the world, including the United
States, and nobody who understands computer science and technology at the level that you, at the
highest possible level, would ever even be in that room.

Gary Tan: And so Palantir's sort of really, really big idea that they discovered very early was that
the problems that those places face, they're actually multi-billion dollar, sometimes trillion
dollar problems. And yet, this was well before AI became a thing. You know, I mean, people were sort
of talking about machine learning, but, you know, back then they called it data mining. You know,
the world is awash in data. These, you know, giant databases of people and things and transactions
and we have no idea what to do with it. That's what Palantir was, is, and still is. That you can go
and find the world's best technologists who know how to write software to actually make sense of the
world. You know, you have these petabytes of data and you don't know how you find the needle in the
haystack.

Gary Tan: Um, and you know, the wild thing is, going on something like 20, 22 years later, it's only
become more true that we have more and more data and we have less and less of an understanding of
what's going on. And it's no mistake that actually now that we have LLMs, we actually, it is
becoming much more tractable. And then the forward deployed engineer title was specifically, how do
you sit next to literally the FBI agent who's investigating domestic terrorism? How do you sit right
next to them in their actual office and see what does the case coming in look like? What are all the
steps? Uh, when you actually need to go to the federal prosecutor, what are the things that they're
sending? Is it—I mean, what's funny is like literally it's like Word documents and Excel
spreadsheets, right?

Gary Tan: And um, what you do as a forward deployed engineer is take these sort of, you know, file
cabinet and fax machine things that people have to do and then convert it into really clean
software. So, you know, the classic view is that it should be as easy to actually do an
investigation at a three-letter agency as going and taking a photo of your lunch on Instagram and
posting it to all your friends. Like, that's, you know, kind of the funniest part of it. And so, you
know, it's no mistake today that forward deployed engineers who came up through that system at
Palantir, now they're turning out to be some of the best founders at YC, actually.

Host: Yeah. I mean, produced this incredible number of startup founders because, yeah, like the
training to be a forward deployed engineer, that's exactly the right training to be a founder of
these companies. Now, the other interesting thing about Palantir is like other companies would send
like a salesperson to go and sit with the FBI agent, and like Palantir sent engineers to go and do
that. I think Palantir was probably the first company to really institutionalize that and scale that
as a process, right?

Gary Tan: Yeah. I mean, I think what happened there, the reason why they were able to get these sort
of seven and eight and now nine figure contracts very consistently is that instead of sending
someone who's like hair and teeth and they're in there and you know, let's go to the steakhouse. You
know, it's all like relationship and you'd have one meeting. Uh, they would really like the
salesperson and then through sheer force of personality you'd try to get them to give you a seven-
figure contract. And like the time scales on this would be, you know, six weeks, ten weeks, twelve
weeks, like, five years, I don't know. It's like, and the software would never work. Whereas if you
put an engineer in there and you give them, uh, you know, Palantir Foundry, which is what they now
call sort of their core data viz and data mining suites, instead of the next meeting being reviewing
50 pages of, you know, sort of sales documentation or a contract or a spec or anything like that,
it's literally like, "Okay, we built it." And then you're getting like real live feedback within
days.

Gary Tan: And I mean, that's honestly the biggest opportunity for startup founders. If startup
founders can do that, and that's what forward deployed engineers are sort of used to doing, that's
how you could beat a Salesforce or an Oracle or, you know, a Booz Allen or literally any company out
there that has a big office and big fancy, you know, big fancy salespeople with big strong
handshakes. And it's like, how does a really good engineer with a weak handshake go in there and
beat them? It's actually, you show them something that they've never seen before and like make them
feel super heard. You have to be super empathetic about it. Like, you actually have to be a great
designer and product person. And then, you know, come back and you can just blow them away. Like,
the software is so powerful that, you know, the second you see something that makes you feel seen,
you want to buy it on the spot. Is a good way of thinking about it that founders should think about
themselves as being the forward deployed engineers of their own company.

Host: Absolutely. Yeah. Like, you definitely can't farm this out. Like, literally, the founders
themselves, they're technical. They have to be the great product people. They have to be the
ethnographer. They have to be the designer. You want the person on the second meeting to see the
demo you put together based on the stuff you heard. And you want them to say, "Wow, I've never seen
anything like that." And take my money.

Host: I think the incredible thing about this model is this is why we're seeing a lot of the
vertical AI agents take off, precisely because they can have these meetings with the end buyer and
champion at these big enterprises. They take that context and then they stuff it basically in the
prompt and then they can quickly come back in a meeting, like just the next day. Maybe Palantir
would have taken a bit longer and a team of engineers. Here it could be just the two founders go in
and then they would close six, seven-figure deals, which we've seen with large enterprises, which
has never been done before. And it's just possible with this new model of forward deployed engineer
plus AI. It's just accelerating.

Host: It just reminds me of a company I mentioned before on the podcast, like Giger ML, who do
customer support—another customer support—and especially a lot of voice support. And it's just a
classic case of two extremely talented software engineers, not natural salespeople, but they force
themselves to be essentially forward deployed engineers. And they closed a huge deal with Zapier and
then a couple of other companies they can't announce yet. But do they physically go on site like the
Palantir model?

Audience Member: Yes. So they did. So they did all of that where once they close the deal, they go
on site and they sit there with all the customer support people and figuring out how to keep tuning
and getting the software or the LLM to work even better. But before that, even to win the deal, what
they found is that they can win by just having the most impressive demo. And in their case, they've
innovated a bit on the RAG pipeline so that they can have their voice responses be both accurate and
very low latency, sort of like a technically challenging thing to do. But I just feel like in the
pre-sort of the current LLM rise, you couldn't necessarily differentiate enough in the demo phase of
sales to beat out incumbent. Like, you can't really beat Salesforce by having a slightly better CRM
with a better UI. But now because the technology evolves so fast and it's so hard to get this last
five to ten percent correct, you can actually, if you're a forward deployed engineer, go in, do the
first meeting, tweak it so that it works really well for that customer, go back with the demo, and
just get that "Oh wow, like we've not seen anyone else pull this off before" experience and close
huge deals. And that was the exact same case with Happy Robot, who has sold seven-figure contracts
to the top three largest logistic brokers in the world. They build AI voice agents for that. They
are the ones doing the forward deploy engineer model and talking to like the CIOs of these companies
and quickly shipping a lot of product, like very, very quick turnaround. And it's been incredible to
see that take off right now. And it started from six-figure deals, now doing and closing seven-
figure deals, which is crazy. This is just a couple months after.

Host: So that's the kind of stuff that you can do with, uh, I mean, unbelievably very, very smart
prompt engineering actually.

Host: Well, one of the things that's kind of interesting about each model is that they each seem to
have their own personality. And one of the things the founders are really realizing is that you're
going to go to different people for different things. Actually, one of the things that's known a lot
is Claude is sort of the more happy and more human steerable model. And the other one is Llama 4,
which is one that needs a lot more steering. It's almost like talking to a developer. And part of it
could be an artifact of not having done as much RLHF on top of it. So it's a bit more rough to work
with, but you could actually steer it very well if you actually are good at actually doing a lot of
prompting and almost doing a bit more RLHF, but it's a bit harder to work with actually.

Host: Well, one of the things we've been using LLMs for internally is actually helping founders
figure out who they should take money from. And so in that case, sometimes you need a very
straightforward rubric, a zero to 100. Zero being never ever take their money and 100 being take
their money right away. Like they actually help you so much that you'd be crazy not to take their
money. Harj, we've been working on some scoring rubrics around that using prompts. What are some of
the things we've learned?

Harj Taggar: So it's certainly best practice to give LLMs rubrics, especially if you want to get a
numerical score as the output. You want to give it a rubric to help it understand like how should I
think through and what's like an 80 versus a 90. But these rubrics are never perfect. There's often
always exceptions. And you tried it with 03 versus Gemini 2.5, and you found this. This is what we
found really interesting is that you can give the same rubric to two different models, and in our
specific case, what we found is that 03 was very rigid, actually. Like, it really sticks to the
rubric. It heavily penalizes for anything that doesn't fit like the rubric that you've given it,
whereas Gemini 2.5 Pro was actually quite good at being flexible in that it would apply the rubric,
but it could also sort of almost reason through why someone might be like an exception or why you
might want to push something up more positively or negatively than the rubric might suggest. Which I
just thought was really interesting because that's, like, when you're training a person, you're
trying to give them a rubric. Like, you want them to use a rubric as a guide, but there are always
these sort of edge cases where you need to think a little bit more deeply. Um, and I just thought it
was interesting that the models themselves will handle that differently, which means they sort of
have different personalities, right? Like, 03 felt a little bit more like the soldier, sort of like,
"Okay, I'm definitely like, check, check, check, check, check." Um, and Gemini Pro 2.5 felt a little
bit more like a high-agency sort of employee, was like, "Oh, okay. I think this makes sense, but
this might be an exception in this case," which was just really interesting to see.

Host: Yeah. It's funny to see that for investors. You know, sometimes you have investors like
Benchmark or a Thrive. It's like, "Yeah, take their money right away. Their process is immaculate.
They never ghost anyone. They answer their emails faster than most founders. It's, you know, very
impressive." And then, uh, one example here might be, you know, there are plenty of investors who
are just overwhelmed and maybe they're just not that good at managing their time. And so they might
be really great investors and their track record bears that out, but they're sort of slow to get
back. They seem overwhelmed all the time. They accidentally, probably not intentionally, ghost
people. And so this is legitimately exactly what an LLM is for. Like, the debug info on some of
these are very interesting to see. Like, you know, maybe it's a 91 instead of like an 89. We'll see.

Host: I guess one of the things that's been really surprising to me, as you know, we ourselves are
playing with it and we spend, you know, maybe 80 to 90% of our time with founders who are all the
way out on the edge, is, uh, you know, on the one hand, the analogies I think even we use to discuss
this is it's kind of like coding. It kind of actually feels like coding in, you know, 1995. Like the
tools are not all the way there. There's a lot of stuff that's unspecified. We're in this new
frontier. But personally, it also kind of feels like learning how to manage a person, where it's
like, how do I actually communicate the things that they need to know in order to make a good
decision? And how do I make sure that they know how I'm going to evaluate and score them? And not
