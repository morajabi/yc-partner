## Transcript

Host: Since we recorded this Light Cone episode with Scale AI CEO Alexander Wang, Meta has agreed to
invest over $14 billion in Scale, valuing the company at $29 billion. Alex has also announced he
will lead Meta's new AI super intelligence lab. Our conversation you're about to hear covers the
history leading up to this investment, from Scale's early days at YC to its integral role in the
training of foundational models. Let's get to it.

Alexander Wang: The AI industry really continues to suffer from a lack of very hard evals and very
hard tests that show really like the frontier of model capabilities. The biggest thing is you just
have to really, really, really care. When you interview people or when you interact with people, you
can tell people who are just sort of like phoning it in versus people who sort of like hang on to
their work. It's like the so incredibly monumental and forceful and important to them that they do
great work. Very exciting time to see how the frontier of human knowledge expands.

Host: Welcome to another episode of the Light Cone. Today we have a real treat. It's Alexander Wang
of Scale AI. Jared, you worked with Alexander way back in the beginning actually. What was that
like? What year was it? Put us in the spot.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, Alex. I mean, most of what we want to talk about today is like what Scale is
doing now because like the current stuff is like so awesome and so interesting. Since Scale got
started at YC, I thought it just seemed appropriate to start all the way at the start. And um, you
know, it's funny. Diane and I were at MIT last month talking to college students and like of all the
founders, the one that they like most look up to and like want to emulate is actually you. Like
everybody wants to be the next Alexander Wang. Everybody knows the story of how you dropped out of
MIT and ended up starting Scale, but they don't know the real story. And so I thought it'd be cool
to go back to the beginning and just talk about the real story of how you ended up dropping out of
MIT and starting Scale.

Alexander Wang: So before I went to MIT, I worked at Quora for a year. And so this is 2015 to 2016.
Or no, sorry, 2014 to 2015 was when I worked as a software engineer. And this was already at a point
in the market where ML engineers, as they were called, or like machine learning engineers, made more
than software engineers. So that was already like the market state at that point. I went to these
summer camps that were organized by rationalists, the rationality community in San Francisco. So
they were for precocious teams, but they were organized by many people who have become pivotal in
the AI industry. So one of the organizers is this guy Paul Christiano who used to be, who's the
inventor of RLHF actually, and now he runs, or he's a research director at the US AI Safety
Institute. He was at OpenAI for a long time. Greg Brockman came and gave a speech at one point.
Eliezer Yudkowsky came and gave a speech at one point. And actually, when I was, I don't know, must
have been about 16, I was exposed to this concept that like potentially the most important thing to
work on in my lifetime was AI and AI safety. So something I was exposed to very early, very early
on.

So then when I went to MIT, I started MIT when I was 18. I studied AI quite deeply. That was most of
what I did in the sort of day job. And then I kind of got antsy, applied to YC. And then the idea
was kind of like, okay, how could you initially apply AI to things? And this was in the era of
chatbots, which is like crazy to think about actually, that there was like this mini chatbot bubble
boom.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%. In 2016, which is I guess spurred by Magic or some of these
apps. And Facebook had a big vision around chatbots. And anyway, there's this little mini chatbot
boom.

Alexander Wang: So the initial thing that we wanted to work on was chatbots for doctors, right?
Which is like a funny idea because do you guys know anything about doctors?

Jared Friedman: Yeah. No, not at all.

Alexander Wang: Like basically no. It was just sort of like, oh, doctors are a thing that sound
expensive. And so I think it was indicative of, like, I mean, I don't know, you guys see this all
the time, but I feel like most of the time young founders' first ten ideas are always. First of all,
they're very memetic, so they're probably like there's a lot of the same ideas over there. There's
like a dating app, there's like something for like social life, you know, there's the same ideas.
And then I think that young people have a very poor sense of alpha, like what are the things that
they're actually going to be uniquely positioned to do? And I think you know, most young people
don't have a sense of self, so it's not clear.

So when we were in YC, we were roommates with another YC company. And we were sort of observing this
chatbot boom that was happening at the time. But it was very clear that if you wanted to build
chatbots, and this is funny to say in retrospect, required lots of data and required lots of like
human elbow grease to be able to get them to work effectively. And so like, just kind of off the
cuff at one point, it was like, oh, what if you just did that? What if you just did the data and the
language data and the human data, so to speak, for the chatbot companies?

We were also very lost, by the way. I think you probably remember. We were quite lost mid-batch,
like many YC companies, I think. And so then we switched to this concept. I think the initial idea
was like an API for human tasks or something along those lines. And one night I was just trolling
around for domains. scaleapi.com was available, and then we just bought it and launched it, I think
a week later on Product Hunt.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, I remember the Product Hunt page is still live. I was reading it last night
and I remembered the tagline. It was an API for human labor. Like that's my recollection of sort of
like the distilled insight that you had, was like, what if there is an API? What if you could call a
human with like an API?

Alexander Wang: Yeah, and that was, I mean, I think it was like three days for us to put up the
landing page. It launched on Product Hunt. I think this idea captured some amount of imagination of
the startup community at the time because it was sort of like this weird form of futurism where you
have humans delegated to via APIs. Humans delegate to via APIs in this interesting way. It's like an
inversion of.

Jared Friedman: Yes, yeah. Humans doing work for the machines instead of the other way around.

Alexander Wang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's funny because the initial phase, you know, we just worked
with all these engineers who reached out to us from that Product Hunt, which was a real grab of use
cases. But then that was enough for us to raise money at the time and get going. And then a few
months after that, it became clear that self-driving cars was actually the first major application
that we needed to focus on. And so there were many very big decisions, I would say, in the first
year or so of the company. One thing that was curious is at that point there were other solutions
that were already in the game, like Mechanical Turk from Amazon, which was sort of the thing that
people were using. But you ended up capturing this whole other set of people that didn't know about
it and you had a way better API and you kind of won.

Jared Friedman: Yeah. It was not clear at that point because you probably were compared a lot with
Mechanical Turk.

Alexander Wang: Yeah, so Mechanical Turk was definitely sort of the concept in most people's mind at
the time. I mean, it was just one of these things where I think a lot of people had heard about it,
but anyone who had used it knew it was just awful. And so it's like whenever you're in a space and
that's kind of the thing—it's like people mention a thing, but it sucks—that's usually like a pretty
good sign. And so that was enough to give us early confidence. But then I think the thing that
really was fundamental to the success of the company was actually focusing on this seemingly very
narrow problem of self-driving cars. I think that, you know, I remember very early on, maybe like
six months after we were out of YC, there was another YC company, Cruise, that reached out to us on
our website. And sort of in the blink of an eye, they became our largest customer. And they found
you just from your launch?

Jared Friedman: Or yeah, just yeah, I think maybe even Google. Like, it's not even totally obvious,
but just vaguely from our launch and vaguely. It was actually an XYC founder that was working at
Cruise that reached out to us. So maybe some YC mumbo jumbo.

Alexander Wang: We're a ketti. Yeah, uh, who knows? The world works in mysterious ways. But and so
they grew very, very large. So then early on we made this decision. And I remember we went to our
lead investor at the time and you know, we had this conversation. It's like, hey, actually we think
we should probably just focus on this self-driving thing. You know, it was actually a very
interesting conversation because the reaction was like, oh, that's just obviously way too small a
market. You're never going to build like a gigantic business that way. And we were like, we think
it's probably a much bigger market than you think it is because there's all these self-driving
companies getting crazy amounts of funding and the automotive companies are doing huge programs in
self-driving. And it clearly is the future. Like it feels like something that should exist. And so
we're like, if we focus on it, we think we can build the business much more quickly.

And it's funny looking back because both things are true. It is both true that it enabled us to
build the business and get to scale pretty very quickly, and it is also true that that was not a big
enough market to sustain a gigantic business. The story of Scale in many ways is like this
progression of, like, how do you continue? You know, AI is this incredibly dynamic space. Lots of
things are constantly changing. And a lot of what we pride ourselves on at the company is how we've
been able to continue building on and contributing to this very fast-moving industry.

Jared Friedman: When did you become much more aware of the scaling laws? Because you know, one of
the interesting facts that sort of emerged is that you're a little bit the Jensen Huang of data, I
think.

Alexander Wang: In self-driving, scaling laws were not really a thing. And the fundamental, the
biggest reason actually was that one of the biggest problems in self-driving is that your whole
algorithm needs to run on the car. And so you're very constrained by the amount of compute you have
access to. So like a lot of the engineers and a lot of the companies working on self-driving never
really thought about scaling laws. They were just all thinking about, okay, how do you keep grinding
these algorithms to be better and better that are small enough to fit onto these cars?

But then we started working with OpenAI in 2019. This was like GPT-2 era. And I would say GPT-1, GPT
was sort of like this curiosity. GPT-2, I remember OpenAI would have a booth at these large AI
conferences and their demo would be to allow researchers to talk to GPT-2. And it was like mildly
interesting. It wasn't particularly impressive, but it was kind of cool, sort of this thing. And
then I think by GPT-3, it was sort of like that's when the scaling laws clearly felt very real. And
that was, I mean, I think GPT-3 was 2020, which is actually long before the world caught on to what
was happening.

Jared Friedman: Did you know as early as 2020? Did you have a strong inkling that this was really
going to be like the next big chapter of Scale? Or not until ChatGPT took off? Was it 3.5 or was it
4?

Alexander Wang: I think that in 2020, it was clear that scaling laws were going to be a big thing,
but it was still not totally obvious. I remember this interaction. I got early access to GPT-3 and
then it was in the playground. And then I was playing with it with a friend of mine. And I told the
friend of mine, oh, you can talk to this model. And during the conversation, my friend got like
visibly frustrated and angry at the AI, but in a way that wasn't just like, oh, this is a dumb toy.
It was in a way that was somewhat personal. And that's when I realized like, whoa, this is like
somehow qualitatively different from anything that had existed before. I feel like it was passing
the Turing test at that point.

Jared Friedman: Kind of. It was like semblances.

Alexander Wang: Yeah, semblance. It was like sort of like the glimpses of it potentially passing the
Turing test, right? But I think the thing that really caused the recognition of, I would say,
generative AI—which is still even the term in some ways—it was really DALL-E, I think, that
convinced everyone. But I think my personal journey was like GPT-3 was like highly interesting. And
then it was like one of many bets at the company. And then in 2022, over the course of DALL-E and
then later ChatGPT and you know, GPT-4, etc., and we worked with OpenAI on InstructGPT, which is
kind of the precursor to ChatGPT, it became very obvious that that was like the farm moment for the
company and for frankly the world.

Jared Friedman: That's when we saw it as well with the big shift in companies because it was that
3.5 moment, release end of 2022. And we started seeing a bunch of companies and smart people
changing directions and pivoting their companies in 2023. And that was that moment. This dynamic
that you referenced, which is kind of the, you know, Scale's the NVIDIA for data kind of thing. Um,
I think that became quite obvious.

Alexander Wang: I would say GPT-4 really was the moment where it was like, wow, this is like scaling
laws are very real. The need for data will basically grow to consume all available information and
knowledge that humans have. And so it was like, wow, this is like an astronomically large
opportunity.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, for the first time it was something that you could get to not hallucinate
basically ever. You could actually have a zero hallucination experience in limited domains. And
which is we're still sort of in that regime even at this point. You know, the classic view is that
if it's hallucinating, you're not giving it.

Jared Friedman: The correct data in the prompt or context or you're trying to do too much in one
step.

Alexandr Wang: I mean, I think the reasoning paradigm has a lot of lags and it's actually been
interesting this last era of model improvement because the gains are not really coming from pre-
training. So we're moving on to a new scaling curve of reasoning and reinforcement learning, but
it's shockingly effective. And I think the analogies between AI and Moore's Law are pretty clear,
which is like you'll get on different technical curves, but if you zoom way out it'll feel like this
smooth improvement of models.

Jared Friedman: One of the things that has been popping up with some of the really big, well-known
rappers is they're getting access to full parameter fine-tunes of the base models, especially the
frontier base closed source models. Is that a big part of your business or something that people are
coming to you for—these verticalized full parameter fine-tuned datasets?

Alexandr Wang: Yeah, I think this is going to be a blueprint for the future. Right now, the total
number of large-scale parameter fine-tuned or reinforcement fine-tuned models is still pretty small,
but if you think about it, one version of the future is that every firm's core IP is actually their
specialized model or their own fine-tuned model. Just in the same way that today you would generally
think the IP of most tech companies is their codebase, in the future you would generally think their
specialized IP might be the model that powers all of their internal workflows. And what are the
special things they can add on top? They can add data and environments that are somehow specific,
very specific, to the day-to-day problems or information or challenges or business problems that
they see on a day-to-day level. And that's the kind of really gritty real-world information that
nobody else will have because nobody else is doing the exact same business motion as them.

Jared Friedman: There's a lot of weird tension in that though. I remember friends of ours from one
of the top model companies came by and they were like, "Hey, do you think YC and YC companies would
give us their evals so we could train against it?" And we were like, "No, dude, what are you talking
about? Why would they do that?" Because that's their moat. And then I guess now, based on this
conversation, it's actually—I mean, evals are pretty important as part of RL cycles. And then even
the evals aren't really the valuable part. The valuable part is actually the properly fine-tuned
model for your dataset and your set of problems.

Alexandr Wang: Yeah, it's like these Lego blocks, right? If you have the data and you have the
environments and then you have a base model, you can stack those on top of each other, get a fine-
tuned model. And obviously the evals are important. This is some of the tension and this is
basically the question of whether AGI becomes a Borg that swallows the whole economy with one firm
or if you still have a specialized economy. My belief generally speaking is that you still do have a
specialized economy. These models are platforms, but the alpha in the modern world will be
determined by the degree to which you're able to encapsulate your business problems into datasets or
environments that are conducive towards building differentiated models or differentiated AI
capabilities.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, that's why asking for evals was so crazy to me because it's like, "Okay, you
get the evals, the base model is way better, and now all your competitors have exactly the same
thing that used to be your advantage."

Alexandr Wang: I think we will undergo a process in AI where we learn what the bright lines are. I
mean, it's very obvious and intuitive to tech companies that they should not give away their
codebase and they should not give away their database. They should not give away their data, they
should not give away their codebase. The analogues of that in a highly AI-fueled economy will be
identified over time, but are—the evals, your data, your environments, etc.

Jared Friedman: I think you have a very techno-optimistic view of what the future is going to be
with how jobs are going to be shaped. Can you talk more about that? Because I think you hinted at it
before—it's going to be more specialized. It's not that all these jobs are going to go away, right?

Alexandr Wang: First off, it's undeniably true that we're at the beginning of an era of a new way of
working. There's this term that people have used a long time which is "the future of work." Well, we
are entering the future of work or certainly the next era, and work fundamentally will change. But I
do think humans own the future and we have a lot of agency and a lot of choice in how this
reformatting of work or how the reformatting of workflows ends up playing out. You know, I think you
kind of see this play out in coding right now. And I think coding in some ways is really the case
study for other fields and other areas of work where the initial phase is this assistant-style thing
where you're doing your work and then the models are assisting you a little bit here and there. And
then you go to this cursor agent mode kind of thing where you're synchronously asking the models to
carry out these workflows and you're managing one agent or you're pair programming with a single
agent. And then now with Codex or other systems, it's very clear the paradigm is that you have this
swarm of agents that you're going to deploy on various tasks and you're just going to give all these
tasks and you'll have this cohort of agents that are doing the work that you think is appropriate.
And that last job has a semantic meaning in the current workforce. It's a manager. You're basically
managing this set of agents to do actual work. And so I think AGI doomers take this view that even
this job of managing the agents will just be done by the agents, so humans will be taken out of the
process entirely. But my personal belief is that management is very complicated. Management is also
more about what's the vision that you have and what's the end result you're aiming towards, and
those will be fundamentally driven by humans. I think we have a human-demand-driven economy. So
those will be driven by humans. And I think the terminal state of the economy is, in a nutshell,
large-scale humans managing agents.

Jared Friedman: I have a funny story where a founder friend of mine is trying to promote one of his
junior employees, but they're really smart and they're working on agent infrastructure. And then he
was like, "Hey, do you want to step into management? You've never managed people before. Or if we
hired some people under you, how would you feel about that?" And this mid-twenty-something really
smart engineer is just like, "Why would I do that? Just give me more compute. Look at what just
happened to the model literally last month, and I didn't have to do anything—it just started doing
things that it couldn't do a month ago. Why would I want to manage people? Just give me more agents,
and it's fine."

Alexandr Wang: Okay, so what are the unique things that humans will do over time? I mean, I think
this element of vision is very important. This element of debugging or fixing when things go wrong.
Most of a manager's job, speaking as a manager, is just putting out fires, dealing with problems,
dealing with issues that come up. I think intuitively, the idealistic manager job seems like this
very cushy job because you're like, "Oh yeah, all the other people do all the work and I just
vaguely supervise," and then the reality is obviously highly chaotic. I think people often jump to
this extreme reality where it's like, "Oh yeah, you're just going to manage the agents and live this
Victorian life where all your problems are solved." But no, I think it's still going to be pretty
complicated—getting agents to coordinate well with one another and coordinating the workflows and
debugging the issues that come up. These are still complicated issues. And having seen what happened
in self-driving, which was more or less that it's easy to get to ninety percent, very very hard to
get to ninety-nine percent, I think something similar will happen with large-scale agent
deployments, and that final ten percent of accuracy will require a lot of work.

Jared Friedman: Even for self-driving cars right now, there's remote assist for all these super edge
cases. So there's still a human at the end managing the car.

Alexandr Wang: And the ratio, by the way—I mean, the companies don't publish them, but I think the
ratio is something like five cars to one tele-operator, or maybe even less, maybe three cars per
tele-operator. So the ratio is much lower than people think. I think humans are much more involved
even in self-driving cars than most people appreciate.

Jared Friedman: I mean, which if you put it in that perspective, I think it's still very optimistic.
It's just the output—instead of getting rides, in today's world if you're an Uber driver, you just
do one car. In this world, you can do five cars, right?

Alexandr Wang: Well, you have to believe for an optimistic version of the future where unemployment
is still low—you just have to believe that humans are almost insatiable in their desire and demand.
And that prices will go down, things will become more efficient, and we'll just want more. And I
think this has been a pretty reliable trend for the history of humanity—we have somewhat insatiable
demand. So I have conviction that the economy can get as efficient as it needs or can get
hyperefficient, and then human demand will just continue to fill the bucket.

Jared Friedman: In the twentieth century, when you said "computer," maybe early twentieth century,
people didn't think of a computer as it is today. They thought of a human being that would sit in
front of a punch card tabulator, and that was what a computer was doing. I mean, it was literally a
real person's job. And then of course now today it's like, "Where are all the computers?" Well,
they're actually real computers now. I don't know. It was like the Apollo mission—it was a bunch of
people just crunching numbers with the trajectories of Apollo, and that was it, because the computer
that went on the rocket actually was a microcontroller with I think only like single-digit hertz. It
was a very tiny amount of computations. It was just humans doing it.

Alexandr Wang: Totally. And even this—I mean, I think the concept of being a programmer is somewhat
highly esoteric in the sense that you're writing the instructions for these machines to just do
repetitively. And in some ways, the leverage boost that all humans will get is similar to the
leverage boost that programmers have had historically for a long time. I think a lot of people in
Silicon Valley say this—the closest thing to alchemy in our world pre-AI, let's say, is programming.
Because you sort of do something that creates infinite replicas of whatever you build, and they can
sort of run an infinite number of times. And I think the entire human workforce will soon see that
kind of large leverage boost, which is extremely exciting because I think programmers have benefited
over the past few decades from this unique perch where one 10x or 100x engineer can build something
absolutely incredible and very valuable and shockingly productive. And all of a sudden, I think
humans in all trades will gain this level of leverage.

Jared Friedman: Alex, I'm curious to return to a point that you made earlier about how Scale has
kept reinventing itself. If you had to describe the arc of Scale, what's the story and what were the
turning points?

Alexandr Wang: Our initial business was all around producing data, generating data for various AI
applications, and primarily self-driving car companies. For the early years it was really focused on
that. Yeah, for the first like three years, fully focused on that. One of the properties of focusing
on that business, of building that business, is that over time we had this obligation to really get
ahead of most of the waves of AI, if that makes sense. Because for AI to be successful in any
vertical area, it needed data, and so our demand for our products would precede a lot of times the
actual evolution of AI into those industries. So, as an example, we started working with OpenAI on
language models in 2019. We started working with the DoD on government AI applications and defense
AI applications in 2020. This is long before I think the recent drone-fueled AI craze in the
Department of Defense. We started working with enterprises long before the recent waves around
enterprise AI implementation. So almost systematically or intrinsically, we've had to basically
build ahead of the waves of AI. I think this is actually quite similar to Nvidia—whenever Jensen
gives his annual presentations about Nvidia and its two-trend outlook, he's always so ahead of the
trends. And that's because he has to get there on the trend before the trend can even happen. That's
been one way in which our business continues to adapt because AI is this fastest-moving industry, I
think, ever in the history of the world.

Alexandr Wang: So you know, that each, each turn, um, each evolution has been has moved incredibly
quickly. The other thing that happened late 2021, early 2022, um, we started working on um
applications, and so we started building out uh AI-based applications, and now, uh, much more so,
uh, agentic workflows and agentic applications um for enterprises and government customers. And this
was an interesting evolution of our business because, historically, like, our core business is
highly operational. You know, we build this like data foundry. We have all these processes to
produce data. Um, it's a very operational process that involves like lots of humans and human
experts to be able to produce data with quality control systems in place. That highly operational
business, um, and the success of that business is what created the momentum for us to, you know,
sort of dream about building an applications business.

When we went into it, uh, I had studied other businesses that had basically successfully um, added
on very different businesses and what are sort of like the unique traits or, or why do some of those
work, and one of them that is probably the most interesting, um, I think, is like the most singular
in modern uh, modern business history is um, Amazon building AWS. You know, if in 2000 you had
written a short story that said that like, you know, this large online retailer would build this
like large-scale cloud computing, rent-to-server business, like it would seem like nonsensical. I
remember when they launched AWS in 2006, Amazon stock went down because all the analysts thought it
was such a terrible idea. It never been done before. It just like it doesn't seem related at all to
their core business. Um, it has, it's like this like weird thing, but the sort of like wisdom of
that was, I think, twofold. I think, like, first um and uh, from talking to people who are like
there at the, out, you know, the sort of like the genesis moment of this business, like one thing,
probably the most important thing, was that they had conviction that that the sort of like
underlying business model of AWS would basically be this like this like infinitely large and growing
market, like that market would would literally grow forever. There would be like this like
exponential of the amount of compute that needed built up, needed to be built up in the world, and
um, if you did that, there was like sufficient cost, you know, cost advantages from economies of
scale.

I think like startups, you know, you kind of like um uh, you kind of have to like switch modes at a
certain point where like early on you're trying to go for very, very narrow markets, like almost the
narrowest markets you can, and then you're just trying to like gain momentum, and then sort of like
slowly grow out from those hyper-narrow markets. And then um, at some point, you, if you like have
ambitions to be a hundred billion dollar company or more, then you have to sort of like switch gears
and say, "Where are the infinite markets? Um, and how do you build towards those infinite markets?"
And so um, this was sort of like uh, the moment where we realized that, and and the simple
realization was that every business and every organization was just going to have to reformat their
entire businesses um with AI-driven technology. Um, and now, obviously, like, agent-driven
technology, and that would just be like, over time, that would swallow the entire economy. And so it
was like another one of these like, "Okay, that's an infinite business to build out AI applications
and AI deployments for large enterprises and governments."

Host: I think a lot of people don't realize that you guys are in the middle of this transformation.
They still think of Scale as the data labeling company, but like, if you fast forward 10 years, do
you think most of Scale will actually be the agent business?

Alexandr Wang: Yeah, it's it's growing much faster at this point. And I think it, it's an infinite
market. So the crappy thing about most markets is that they have like a pretty shallow S-curve. Um,
but then you know, you look at hyperscalers or like you know, these like mega-cap tech companies,
and they just have like these like ridiculously large markets. So you really want to get into these,
these, these like um infinite markets. So our strategy so far has been to focus on building use
cases for, you know, focus on a small number of customers and um and be quite selective. So we work
with you know, the number one pharma company in the world, the number one telco in the world, the
number one uh bank, the number one um healthcare provider, um, and we work a lot with the US
government, you know, the Department of Defense and and other government agencies. And um, the whole
thing is like, "How do we take a very focused approach towards building um stuff that resemble, you
know, real differentiated AI capabilities?" And all this I think sounds somewhat trite, but but um,
we have this multi-million dollar business in building all these applications. By my account, I
think it's it's one of the largest AI application businesses um in the industry. Certainly what our
investors tell us, and it's fueled by our differentiation in the data business because our belief
fundamentally is that um, kind of what we talked about before, the end state for every enterprise or
every organization is um some form of specialization um imbued to them by their own data. Our day
jobs, historically, have been producing highly differentiated data for you know, these like large-
scale model builders in the world, and then we can apply that wisdom and that capability and those
operational capabilities towards enterprises and their unique problem sets. And um and give them
specialized applications. Honestly, like it kind of sounds like Palantir here at the like most
zoomed-out level if you sort of like squint and that you're a technology provider. We're like a
technology provider to like the most, you know, some of the largest organizations in the world um
with a focus on data.

Host: Yeah. Um, and I think the key difference is like, you know, Palantir um has built a real focus
around these data ontologies and um and really solving this like messy like data integration problem
for enterprises. Um, and then your whole viewpoint is like, "What is the like most strategic data
that will enable differentiation for your AI strategy, and how do we like generate or harness that
data from within your enterprise towards developing that?"

Alexandr Wang: I guess you will end up being pretty big competitors in another five, ten years, but
for now, like it's basically so green field, honestly. I mean, I think it's an infinitely large
market. The other, so you might not ever meet, actually, which is interesting.

Host: Yeah. Yeah.

Alexandr Wang: I I think in practice now we actually like frankly we work, we're more partnered with
Palantir than than competitive with them.

Host: Yeah. Um, and uh, well, that's because the problems at these giant organizations are actually
so massive and intractable that they'd throw up their hands. It's like they have no shot at ever
hiring people who could possibly solve the problem. Uh, but a company like Scale or a company like
Palantir can actually hire kind of the same kind of people who would apply to YC, actually. It's
kind of like there's this...

Alexandr Wang: Yeah. I don't know, the the through-line in my head right now is realizing like, you
know, there's plenty of capital, and then the limiting agent is actually really great technical,
smart people who uh are optimistic and actually work really hard. There's like not enough of those
people.

Host: That's true for the world.

Alexandr Wang: And by the way, I think one of the cool things about um agents, as we were talking
about before, is that like all of a sudden those people get near-infinite leverage. So, um, I think
we're going to, I think that bottleneck gets exploded now, hopefully, um due to due to AI.

Host: Again, I I think you know, just like how in cloud AWS is the largest by far, but there's so
many other cloud providers that actually are all at like, like it's not a winner-take-all kind of
business, per se, and it doesn't have to be.

Alexandr Wang: Yeah. Exactly. And and and I think that um, it's just too big of a market to even be
close to winner-takes-all. Like I just, there's no single organization that could have the
organizational um, operational breadth to be able to to swallow the whole market.

Host: Talking about uh operations, you clearly are living in the future, which is super cool. I'm
sure you're running Scale with all these agents and tools already to make it very efficient. Could
you share some of the things that you're doing internally as a company and agents you're adopting so
you can do more with less people?

Alexandr Wang: You know, we saw this early because uh, when when the model developers were starting
to develop agents and starting to develop using reinforcement learning, like actual, you know, like
reasoning models where the the models could actually like really do end-to-end workflows. We were uh
responsible for producing a lot of the data sets that enabled um the agents to get there, and then
we saw just like how effective that that training process is. I think that like the efficacy of
reinforcement learning for um for agent deployments is like is pretty insane. So then once we
realize that, we realize like, "Okay, if you can actually like you know turn um existing human-
driven workflows into environments and and data for reinforcement learning. Um, then you have this
ability to convert these like human workflows into, um, human workflows, um, especially ones where
you're like, okay with some level of faultiness and and okay with a certain level of reliability,
you can convert those into um into agentic workflows."

So there's all sorts of like, you know, agent workflows that that happen in our hiring processes and
happen um in our quality control processes and happen to sort of just like automate away certain
like data analyses um and data processes, as well as like various like sales reporting. Like it's
sort of like embedded at you know every major org of the company. Um, and the whole thing is like
um, it's just like mindset. Like, can you identify these like very repetitive human workflows and
basically like undergo this process where you convert that into data sets that enable you to build
automation tools?

Host: What do these data sets actually look like? I mean, for browser use, is like, is it an
environment and then you know, here's a video of a human being going through this process of like
filling out this form and decide like, "Yes, no" on this uh drop-down or something? I mean, you
know, what's a concrete example just for the audience?

Alexandr Wang: One of the processes that we go through is like, you know, you, um, you'll take a
sort of like full packet of a from a candidate, and you'll like want to distill that into like you
know a brief of some sort that sort of like gives all the salient details about that candidate for
like decision by a sort of like broader committee. Um, and these kinds of cases, you know, broadly
speaking, like deep research plus kind of things are like the lowest hanging fruit. It's just sort
of like, "Can you take these processes that like, more or less, look like you know, you have to like
click around a bunch of places and pull a bunch of pieces of information and then blend them
together and then produce some analysis on top of that?" Like, that process, that fundamental like
information-driven sort of like analysis process, is the easiest thing to to drive via workloads,
and the kinds of data you need are just like, you know, um uh, you, we call them kind of
environments, but usually it's just like, "What is the task? What is the the full um sort of like
data set that's necessary to conduct that task? And um, what is like the rubric for how how you
conduct that effectively?"

Host: Do you need RL and fine-tuning when like prompt engineering and metaprompting seems so good?

Alexandr Wang: I think that, yeah, I mean, I think I think prompting, I mean, as the models get
better, prompting will get better, but like, prompting gets you to a certain level, and then
reinforcement learning gets you beyond that level. And um, actually, this is a good point. I I think
that like, probably most of the time in our in our business, it's mostly prompting that just is like
works really well. I mean, that's the weird thing is like, "Oh, shoot, you don't have to crack open
the models," and then frankly, like, the next models are going to be so good, and then the evals are
mainly about picking which model or you know, at what point do you switch to the next one. I do
think startups need basically like a strategy for how they like will um walk up the complexity
curve, so to speak. Like, you need to like, you know, whatever product or business you build, like
needs to like really um benefit from like the ability to like race up this complexity curve, which
is the broader curve of capability of the models.

Host: I mean, you you actually created this uh leaderboard that has a lot of these super hard tasks
that are trying to go into this next curve of uh reasoning. Can you tell us about it?

Alexandr Wang: One of the things that we built um in partnership with the Center for AI Safety is
Humanity's Last Exam. It was a funny name. I think, unfortunately, there will be yet another exam
beyond it. But you know, the idea was, how like, let's effectively work with you know, the the the
smartest scientists in the field, and you know um, you know, we worked with many very brilliant
professors, but also very many like individual researchers who are like quite brilliant, um, and we
just collated and aggregated this data set of what the smartest researchers in the world would say
the hardest scientific problems they've worked on recently are. They solved them, or they sort of
like came to the right, you know, they were able to solve the problems, but they're sort of like the
hardest problems that they're aware of and know of.

Host: I was curious how you came up with these problems. So, each of the professors contributed new
problems. So, these are not, these are problems that have never appeared in any textbook or any exam
ever. They just like came out of their brains, and they like typed up like a new problem like from
scratch. Am I understanding this right?

Alexandr Wang: Yeah. Yeah. And the the general guidance was like, you know, "What has come up
recently in your research that you think is like a is a particularly hard problem, right?" The
problems are stupidly hard, incidentally. They're like insane. I don't know if you guys have looked
at these problems. They're totally crazy.

Host: Yeah. It's totally crazy. And by the way, like, they cannot be searched on the internet. It's
like, you need to have a lot of a lot of expertise and actually think about them.

Alexandr Wang: Yeah. For quite a long time. Yeah. They require a lot of reason. I'm recently, like
uh, right now, so we have a time limit where the models um can only think for I think it's 15
minutes or 30 minutes, and one of the most recent requests from one of the labs was like, "Can you
please increase that time limit to like a day so that the model has like up to a day to think about
the um, to think about the problems?" Um, but yeah, no, they're they're deviously hard problems.
Unless you have expertise in the specific problem, you probably don't have a chance of getting it
right. Um, but even this evaluation, like, I think when we first launched it, um, you know, and this
was just earlier this year, uh, the the best models were scoring like 7%, 8% on it. Now the best
models score north of 20%. It's moved really, really quickly. And I think you know, I think uh, do
you think we're going to get a benchmark saturation for this one as well?

Host: I think eventually, yeah, it'll it'll be saturated, and then we have to move on to new
evaluations. I mean, I think the like uh, the the the saving grace for the naming was that it is the
last exam. The new eval will be sort of like real-world tasks, real-world activities, which are sort
of like fundamentally fuzzier and more complicated. Have you solved any of the problems yourself,
Alex? I know I I know you were a competitive math person for a long time.

Alexandr Wang: Yeah. Yeah. The I mean, the math problems require a lot. They're like very deep in
the fields. I think uh, I was, I managed to get a handful, but like, most of them are like hopeless.
Um, yeah, I looked at the ones that the models can solve, and so so that was that was one of the
evals and we...

Alexandr Wang: we've produced a number of other evaluations, but yeah, I think that the AI industry
really continues to suffer from a lack of very hard evals and very hard tests that show the frontier
of model capabilities. And these evals—when you build an eval that becomes popular in the industry,
it has this deeper effect where that's all of a sudden the North Star and the yard stick that
researchers are trying to optimize for. And so it's actually a very gratifying activity. You know,
we built Humanity's Last Exam. You know, most of the model providers will always report their
results. There's tons of researchers who are really motivated by doing a good job. And the models
are going to get deviously good at frontier research problems.

I guess Sam's starting to talk about how stage four innovators of AGI is coming, and that's the
prognostication for the next year. Do you think that's correct—that the next 12 to 24 months is
really the moment that literal new scientific breakthroughs are coming from the operation of
reasoning in these models?

I mean, I think it's super plausible, you know, in fields like biology—and this is probably one of
the ones that comes up the most. There's probably intuitions that the models have about biology that
humans don't even have, because they have this different form of intelligence, right? And so you'd
expect there to be some areas and some fields where the models have some fundamental deep advantage
versus humans. And so I think it's very realistic to expect in those fields. Biology I think is sort
of the clearest one for me.

Host: Kind of already happened for chemistry. Last year the Nobel Prize went to the Google
team—Demis and John Jumper—with AlphaFold.

Alexandr Wang: Yeah, exactly. That was a huge jump. Before that there was this competition where
they were trying to get more protein fold structures solved and it was abysmal, and AlphaFold
destroyed it. It's a strange time to be a scientist, but an exciting time for science.

There's this short story that talks about this future where there are effectively AIs that are
conducting all the frontier of R&D research, and scientists just sort of look at the discoveries
that the AIs make and try to understand them.

Host: Yeah.

Alexandr Wang: I mean, I think it's a very exciting time to see how the frontier of human knowledge
expands. And I think that'll be great because in areas like biology, it will fuel breakthroughs in
medicine and healthcare and all these other things. And then the majority of the economy will chug
along, you know, giving humans what they want.

China open sourcing—or DeepSeek open sourcing their models—is like another very interesting
question. Like, how does that play out? And there's this awkward sort of thing that the best open
source models in the world now come out of China. I mean, that's sort of an awkward reality to
contend with. And what do you think we can do to make sure that it's the American models that are
ahead? Or is that written in the stars? Or you know, something tells me that's not the simplest
explanation for me. About why the Chinese models are so good is espionage. I think there's a lot of
secrets in how these frontier models are trained. Um, when I say secrets, they sound more
interesting than they are, but there's just a lot of tacit knowledge. There's a lot of tricks and
small intuitions about where to set the hyperparameters and ways to make these models work and to
get model training to work.

The Chinese labs have been able to move so quickly and accelerate and make such fast progress,
whereas some even very talented US labs have made progress less quickly. And I just purely think
it's because a lot of the secrets about how to train these models—those secrets leave the frontier
labs and make their way back to these Chinese labs.

I think the only way to model the future is that China has pretty advanced models. You know, the
solace right now is they're not the best models. They're sort of like a half step behind, let's say.
But it's tough to model what'll happen when it's truly neck and neck.

We're very behind on energy production, which is just pure regulation. Like that could be fixed in
two seconds, but it hasn't been yet. That's a huge problem.

I mean, if you look at US total grid production, it looks flat as a pancake. And if you look at
Chinese aggregate grid production, it's doubled over the past decade. It's just this straight up
trajectory.

Host: I saw that and it's astonishing.

Alexandr Wang: It's a policy failure. China just—the vast majority of that is coal, and coal's
growing in China. And in the United States, renewables have grown a lot, but renewables trade off
against fossil fuels. So we've done a transition of our energy grid, whereas they're just continuing
to compound.

Let's say we have this issue on power production, but we're advantaged on chips. I think net-net we
will come out ahead on compute.

If you look at data—I mean, this goes towards a lot of the questions you've been asking about—but I
think China is fundamentally very well positioned on data. It's weird to say because obviously we
help all the American companies with data. In China, they can ignore copyright and privacy rules and
build these large models without abandon.

And then the second issue is that there's actually large-scale government programs in China for data
labeling. There are seven data labeling centers in various cities that have been started up by the
government itself. There are large-scale subsidies for AI companies to use data labeling—a voucher
system. In fact, there are college programs because one of the interesting things is in China,
employment is such a large national priority that when they have a strategic area like AI, they
figure out what are all the jobs and create these funnels to create those jobs.

And then we're seeing this in robotics data too, where there are already in China large-scale
factories full of robots that go and collect data. And strangely enough, even a lot of US companies
today actually rely on data from China in training these robotics foundation models.

Long story short, I think China likely has an advantage on data. And then on algorithms, the US is
on net much more innovative. But if espionage continues to be a reality, then you're basically even
on algorithms.

So it's hard to model, but I think probably it's like 60-40, 70-30 that the United States has an
undeniable continued advantage. But there are a lot of worlds where China just catches up or
potentially even overtakes.

I mean, the scary thing for me is watching Optimus or—YC has some robotics companies like Weave
Robotics—and we look at those things. The software can be as good or better than anything coming out
of China. But when it comes to hardware, it's like $20,000-$30,000 here. We can't even make high-
precision screws over here. And then over there, the same robot—the embodied robot—could be made for
like $2,000-$4,000, right? You just walk down a street in Shenzhen and they've got it. So how do you
compete against that at a state level?

Host: The degree to which China is incredible at manufacturing—that's a very big problem. And it
relates to defense and national security. It's a fundamental issue because on some level, defense
and national security boil down to which countries have more things that can deter conflict or can
go into situations and shoot other things down.

Alexandr Wang: Yeah. I don't think it's going to be fighter jets and aircraft carriers anymore. I
mean, it's probably going to be this micro war of like—it's hyper-micro. It's drones and embodied
robots.

Host: Yeah, exactly. Drones, embodied robots, cyber warfare.

Alexandr Wang: The cold war era philosophy of building bigger and bigger bombs—it's the exact
opposite of that. It's actually the fragmentation and move towards smaller, more nimble, affordable
resources. That's one of the big picture trends I would say.

And then the other big picture trend is just what we believe, which is the move towards agentic
warfare or agentic defense. Basically, if you map out what warfare looks like today—if you look at
the actual process of conflict, you know, Russia-Ukraine or other conflict areas—the decision-making
processes are remarkably manual and human-driven. All these very critical battle-time decisions are
made with very limited information in these very manual workflows.

And it's very clear that if you used AI agents, you would have perfect information and immediate
decision-making. So we're going to see this huge shift towards agent-driven warfare and agent-driven
conflict, and it has the potential of turning these conflicts into almost incomprehensibly fast-
moving scenarios.

Host: And that's something that you guys are actively working on, right? Can you talk about that? I
assume some of it is classified.

Alexandr Wang: Yeah. So one of the things we're doing is building this system called Thunder Forge
with the Indo-Pacific Command out in Hawaii. It's responsible for the Indo-Pacific region, and it's
the flagship DoD program for using AI for military planning and operations.

We're basically doing exactly what I said. We take the existing human workflow. The military works
in what's called a doctrinal way—they're governed by the doctrine of this very established military
planning process. And you just convert that into a series of agents that work together and conduct
the exact same task, but it's all agent-driven. And all of a sudden you turn these very critical
decision-making cycles from 72 hours to 10 minutes.

And it kind of changes it from—you know, when you play chess against a human, they have to spend all
this time thinking. It's a slow game. And if you play chess against a computer, it's just these
immediate moves back. It's this sort of unrelenting form of warfare.

I mean, some of it—just being able to see the chain of thought immediately was the most powerful
thing.

Host: Yeah, because I don't want the answer. I want to see how you got there. And seeing the
reasoning itself was so powerful. I mean, that's actually why the launch of that first DeepSeek was
way more interesting because 01 had come out but they hid the reasoning. It's like no, the reasoning
is actually a really important part of it. And the only reason they hid it was they didn't want
other people to steal it, which they did anyway.

Alexandr Wang: I think that's another interesting thing about this space, which is that so far you
could really model it as—there are advanced capabilities and you can try to keep those secret and
keep those closed, but they open over time no matter what you do.

Host: Well, clearly, Alex, you've done a lot of incredible things and transformed your company
multiple times. You have all this deep matter expertise in many areas. You're clearly hardcore. Is
there advice for the audience to be more like you?

Alexandr Wang: I think the biggest thing is you just have to really, really, really care. And I
think it's a folly of youth in some ways that when you're young, almost everything feels so
astronomically important that you just try immensely hard and you care about every detail.
Everything matters just way more to you. And I think that trait is really, really important.

I wrote this post many years ago called "Hire People Who Give a F***," and it really is pretty
simple. I noticed that when you interview people or interact with people, you can tell people who
are just phoning it in versus people who hang on to their work like it's so incredibly monumental
and forceful and important to them that they do great work. And it eats at them when they don't do
great work. And when they do great work, they're so satisfied with themselves.

There's this magnitude of care. And one of the greatest indicators of how much I enjoyed working
with people or frankly how successful they were at scale was really just—to what degree is their
soul invested in the work that they do? And so I think if you were to pick one thing, that probably
is the sort of unifier in some way.

It's like—I care a lot. I care a lot about every decision we make at the company. I still review
every hire at the company. We have this process where I approve or reject literally every single
hire at the company. And so I care immensely. And then I work with all these people who care
immensely. And then that enables us to really feel much more deeply what happens in the business. As
a result, we change course more quickly, we learn more quickly, we take our work more seriously, we
adapt more quickly. And I think that's been quite important to the success we've had.

Host: Alex, you were telling me a story recently that stuck with me about how quite recently—even
when Scale was a very large company—you were personally hand-reviewing all the data that was being
sent to partner companies and being like basically the final quality control, like, you know, that
data point is not good enough.

Alexandr Wang: Yeah, exactly. I think a lot of founders would probably agree with this. But what
your customers feel—when your customers are happy and sad—it really gets to you. And so when you...

Alexandr Wang: Have when you have unhappy customers, it's like, it's like personally a very painful
thing. Broadly speaking, you know, we have this value at our company: quality is fractal. And I do
believe that like high standards, sort of like, um, they trickle down within an organization. And
you know, it's very rare that you see an organization where standards increase as you get lower and
lower down in the organization. You know, most of the time when people realize their manager, or
their management manager, or their director, or whomever, don't really care, then they sort of, you
know, that removes the sort of deep desire to need to care. Um, and so it's incredibly important
that high standards and this sort of deep care for quality is like deeply embedded, sort of, a
tenant of the entire organization. Founder mode, man. Founder mode, man.

Host: We got to have you back. Thank you so much for spending time with us. With that, sorry we're
out of time, but we'll see you next time.

Audience: Heat. Hey, heat. Hey, heat.
