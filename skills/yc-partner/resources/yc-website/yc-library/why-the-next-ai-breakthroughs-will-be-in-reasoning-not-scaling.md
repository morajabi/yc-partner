## Transcript

Gary Tan: I remember about a year ago one of these conversations around are we going to have AGI,
what would that look like? One of the arguments for it was that well, like at some point the AI will
get good enough to just like design chips better than humans can, and then it will just like
eliminate one of its bottlenecks for getting greater intelligence. So it feels like we're on the
pathway to that in a way that we just weren't before.

The last episode we were talking about, you know, what are you going to do with these two more
orders of magnitude? Since then Sam has told me that he actually wants to go to four orders of
magnitude. It's the worst that these models are ever going to be right now, right this moment. Week
to week, you know, there are things that you couldn't do maybe a month ago that you could do really,
really well right now. So that sounds like a pretty crazy moment in history. Welcome back to another
episode of the Light Cone. I'm Gary. This is Jared Harge and Diana, and at Y Combinator we've funded
companies worth more than $600 billion, and we fund hundreds of companies every single year. So
we're right there on the edge of seeing what is going to work both in startups and in AI.

Recently, Sam Altman wrote this pretty wild essay that predicted that AGI and ASI are coming within
thousands of days. Seeing him on Monday, he actually directly estimated, you know, between four and
15 years. Have you guys read this essay yet? And what do you think?

Jared Friedman: Yeah, I read it. And one interesting place where I think we have a unique
perspective is that we had a front row seat to the very beginnings of OpenAI because OpenAI
basically spun out of YC. And so what was cool to me reading this essay is that it's literally the
same ideas that Sam was talking about in 2015 when he started OpenAI. Like, he's been talking about
this basically since I've known the guy. Um, and in 2015 when he said these things, he sounded kind
of like a crazy person, and not that many people took him seriously. And now 10 years later, it
turns out he was right. And actually, we were much closer to AGI than anybody thought in 2015. And
now it doesn't sound crazy at all. It sounds like totally plausible.

Gary Tan: I mean, the essay itself is pretty much the most techno-optimist thing I've read in a
really long time. Some of the things that he says are coming are pretty wild. Space colonies, fixing
the climate problem, um, your intelligence on to being able to solve abundant energy. Yeah, I think
he's basically ushering in this sort of Star Trek future on the back of literally human intelligence
being able to figure out all of physics.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, Sam was always a realist. Like, I remember back when he was starting OpenAI,
one of the things that really motivated him to do it was he believed that when we actually had AGI,
basically it'd be better at doing science than humans were, and therefore would accelerate the rate
of all scientific progress in every scientific field. That was part of the motivation from the very
beginning. And I think is really connected to o1. Even when Sam came and spoke at our batch a year
ago—this is long before o1 was publicly released, but it was being worked on in secret by
OpenAI—that was the thing that he was most excited to talk about: giving GPT more advanced reasoning
capabilities. And I think this is the reason. It's because the thing that's missing from its ability
to actually do science and like accelerate technological progress is it needs to be able to think
through things.

Diana Hu: One thing that really stood out about o1 in particular—if you read one of the papers
talking about it, so capabilities and potential for the future—it talks about how it does really
well in chip design. And I remember about a year ago, one of these conversations around are we going
to have AGI, what would that look like? Like, what one of the arguments for it was that well, like
at some point the AI will get good enough to just like design chips better than like humans can, and
then it will just like eliminate one of its bottlenecks for like getting greater intelligence. And
so it feels like that's already kind of like we're on the pathway to that in a way that we just
weren't before.

Diana's going to show a cool demo of it doing exactly that.

Gary Tan: It's fun because we run this hackathon with OpenAI, and Sam came over and judged the
winners. And one of the participants was actually chip design. This company is called Diode
Computer. I think we mentioned them earlier. What they're building is basically an AI designer for
circuit design. And their previous product—it could handle, in you think about PCB design, there's
four major steps. The big expensive part that you need a lot of—all of these need a lot of
expertise. It's like the system design: how do you really put together the architecture of it? How
do you design all the components, like the resistors, I need the sensors, the specific processing
units? Then you need to go do the layout of schematics, placing, then doing the routing. And routing
is known to be an NP-complete problem because as you have different layers in circuit boards,
there's interference. And this is why companies like Nvidia, Intel, Apple have gazillions of
electrical engineers because this is an NP-complete problem.

Up to GPT-4, which is this company had built, it actually put some constraints and was able to
automate a lot of the schematic design that you as a human had to design—what components it needed
to go in the design—and to some extent the routing, which is still pretty cool. Up to that point, so
they were able to automate all that. But the thing that they demonstrated now with o1 was actually
able to do the system design and component selection, which is crazy. So it would be able to read
all the datasheets and select the right components. So the way the product would work: it could say,
"I want to build a wearable heart rate monitor with an accelerometer and a microcontroller," very
high level. And given this constraint and looking at the database, it would be able to match the
specific accelerometer and microcontroller and heart rate monitor sensor and connect it and just
output the end result.

Speaker: What we are trying to build today is a wearable heart rate monitor, something like you
would see in a Whoop, for example. Um, the o1 is amazing, but one of the downsides is that it's a
bit slow. So we actually cached a pre-generated system diagram. The other one was able to generate
it. It's pretty good. It has a USB-C connector, an IMU like we requested, a heart rate sensor, um,
and like, this is a microcontroller. So I'm going to show you how you can go from this and like
build a PCB. So we are going to like build the project. Um, the output of this is code. We actually
use Verilog, which is an electronic source code language, and you can see that it took all the
blocks in the block diagram, stitch them together exactly how we want. Um, and the second step is it
actually is going to generate a layout for the board. Um, and so now like we can directly open it,
and here you go. Here's the board. It's quite—it's quite nice. Uh, there's still like a couple of
like fine-tuning steps required. For example, um, we could like move like this USB Type-C connector
slightly. Um, we can like change the shape of the board. But these are all the components. Um, and
then like, thanks to the system that we built, uh, we can like call the auto-router on this specific
board and actually get a fully working printed circuit board back.

Gary Tan: So this is actually one of the examples on the o1 paper that it would do EDA, but actually
they went a step further forward because the example on the paper they described the EDA as a step
process. It's this set of tools for circuit design. It does sort of the design of the schematic,
also the simulation and bug verification. It's easier to verify stuff than to select and write it.
So this company actually went a step further beyond the paper because the paper did mostly the last
stages of verification and simulation.

I guess it's an interesting example of using different models for different tasks and in different
workflows. So in order to pick the correct components off the bat, you know, even before you place
it on a circuit board, you've got to actually have probably RAG on structured, you know, taking
unstructured data like PDF documentation and turning into a structured form that then 4o mini sounds
like is being used to actually extract the data and then put it into a format for o1.

Diana Hu: I think this is actually a very common pattern that we're seeing. A lot of the interesting
products built with AI use different kinds of models. So yes, 4o mini for PDF extraction and then o1
for the reasoning because it's actually very hard to select the components for parts.

Jared Friedman: I know Jared also works with a lot of hardware companies, and the whole part of
selecting, whatever, the servos, the motors, the sensors—it's like, so, is it? It takes a lot of
thinking for humans, yeah.

Gary Tan: The other thing I think is interesting about this example is like, during the batch before
o1 came out, Diode had tried to do this with GPT-4, and it just flat out didn't work. And then they
basically tried the same thing, the same prompts, but fed it to o1 and boom, all of a sudden it
worked. And so there really is a sort of like step-function capability unlock. They were so excited
when I talk to them and they show me, they were they had this big smile. It's like, wow, they
themselves were super impressed.

This hackathon that Diana ran, incidentally, I think it was a really interesting concept for a
hackathon. Like, most hackathons are like people who are just sort of like building something that
they plan to throw away. Um, and the cool thing about this hackathon is it was all actual YC-funded
startups that have real businesses, that have funding, that have like a real thing with real users.
And they were all building actual features for their product that they plan to release to real
users. It was really cool, I think, for us to see how o1 unlocked capabilities for real companies,
not just like toy projects.

Harj Taggar: Yeah, there's another one that was similar in here in terms of reasoning for o1. I
think Harj, you work with Camber?

Jared Friedman: Yep, so want to tell us what Camber does?

Harj Taggar: Uh, it's—I mean, the tagline is "dev for CAD," but basically they um, let you create
CAD designs with just natural language. Like you just type in like, you know, something that you
want to design, and it just like spits out like a CAD design for you. "Can you design me five
airfoils optimized for 50 mph with a minimum drag to lift ratio of 1.5 at a 5° angle of attack?"
That's very specific. Normally, this would require an actual mechanical engineer to be running all
the simulations and solving through the equations. And what you're seeing, why it's like flashing,
is like running all the multiple simulations—four of them at the same time. So it's actually kind of
like a co-pilot to Solidworks, yeah. They actually built their—like, initially they were going to
build this as a plugin to Solidworks, but they went for like the even harder technical approach,
which was like, now this is just like an executable that runs on desktop and it essentially opens up
Solidworks for you and then just starts like clicking around in the UI pretending to be a person.
Yeah, nice. And you saw there what was really cool earlier? They flashed the math trace. So o1 was
actually able to write all of these equations, all these partial differential equations, and solve
basically Navier-Stokes equations to actually solve airfoils. That is really cool.

Gary Tan: The last episode we were talking about, you know, what are you going to do with these two
more orders of magnitude? Since then, Sam has told me that he actually wants to go to four orders of
magnitude to get to a trillion dollars in, uh, you know, sort of spend. I mean, pretty wild. But on
the other hand, like, you could see where that might go. You know, you could imagine an airfoil is
still, it's, you know, very impressive and complex, but sort of what we're capable of doing today in
2024. You could imagine abstracting that to like understanding the nature of physics, I suppose.
Like, it would be sort of hard to see that, maybe in the current version of o1, but if the scaling
laws hold, it seems entirely plausible that, you know, far more difficult engineering challenges
such as, um, you know, room temperature fusion—like, these are all sort of ultimately engineering
physics mechanics. There's weather prediction. There's all these complex physical phenomena that are
very hard to solve, and you need basically PhDs. And to Sam's essay, this is a glimpse into what AI,
and where o1 is heading with this chain-of-thought and reasoning, especially like, like, Sam says
the vibes are sort of training intelligence and this new age of intelligence. And then the o1 paper
just—that I think this whole idea of now you can actually give like feedback, not just on like the
outputs and whether you got the correct answer, but like on all of the steps to get there. And like
you're basically teaching a model how to think. Like the Camber guys are mentioning too, right? The
reasoning traces, and they can probably go back and like fine-tune the various steps for like every
output to make sure that the model's thinking how they want it to think. That one that just is again
very like the AGI conversations. I feel like a year ago were all sort of in this direction of like,
what happens once you can actually start teaching the models to think better versus just like, um,
spitting out the correct answers? Uh, and then the scaling laws—this is like even more surface area
for like throwing compute at the problem, right? Like, now you can just basically put compute at the
inference step and iteratively have something come out that, you know, you can actually spend more
money and more time and have a result that iteratively gets better, similar to what you might expect
from a human scientific organization.

Diana Hu: Yep, maybe more consistently even. Di, do you want to talk about the architecture and how
they actually created o1? I think a lot of it is inspired from what they've been working on for many
years since the beginning of OpenAI. I think one of the inspirations is a lot of the work they did
with Dota.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, does everyone remember when, like, before OpenAI was famous for GPT, the one
thing that it was like kind of famous for—that at least people in the tech industry knew—was Dota?
Was like winning video game competitions. That was their first big breakthrough. And the funny
thing, I think, back then Dota wasn't something that took the world by storm. I mean, maybe only the
research community kind of knew about it, but it wasn't anything practical. But what was impressing
was beating a lot of the best Dota players. So Dota is this complex game of resources and planning,
right? And they implemented a lot of uh, kind of reinforcement learning type of techniques in there,
which I think were also inspired—early days from AlphaGo and AlphaZero as well—on how it solved Go.
It wasn't just brute forcing through it but actually having a reward function and trying to solve
towards it. And even this is why there's just so much talk about Q-learning because that's sort of
the fundamental algorithm behind the family of algorithms behind RL.

Diana Hu: So yeah, so like because of Dota, they got really good at doing reinforcement learning.
That's how they got it to work. They just had it play against itself like a million games. Um, and
then how does that connect to o1?

Jared Friedman: So I think this is where there's a bit of a big stepping function because how do you
then incorporate that into the family of GPT-type models? GPT is all generative based on predicting
the next token and patterns, and then getting those results to check that they're correct so...

Jared Friedman: I think a lot of it is you had to have a lot of data that was factually correct and
fed into probably the model and the training and having a reward function that gets it to reason a
bit more about the output and make sure that it's correct. So they probably done a lot of
interesting techniques with that and there's probably a lot of secret sauce on the type of data
sources they done. Maybe one of the speculations we could do is a lot of very factually correct
information like math problems and science problems and things like that.

Gary Tan: Yeah, and that's why it outperforms so much on those.

Jared Friedman: Yes, yeah. One of the things I think is interesting, Gary, to your point about the
scaling laws—is a lot of people are really focused on the next scale up of the model like the GPT-5
series of models which are being trained now and people are working on them and they are going to
come out. But I think people may be underappreciating how big an unlock this other direction is
because there are two research directions being explored in parallel, right? Like one is the
straightforward scale up of the underlying LM and then this o1 direction is like a totally
orthogonal research direction in which you unhack the model by having it do reinforcement learning
while actually trying to do things in the real world and getting better at them. The version that's
come out so far—it's still only o1 mini and if you look at the actual, sorry, o1-1 preview—and like
if you look at the performance asset they released, the full o1 model which is coming out any day
now is a huge step function above even o1 preview, which is what enabled all these incredible
results of the hackathon. Sam was just telling us that o2 and o3 are not far behind and so like I
think people maybe are underappreciating just how big an unlock we're going to get.

Gary Tan: Yeah, and o1 also is really opaque still. I mean, from a, you know, sort of business
perspective, this is a new method. I think at great cost to themselves they actually did create a
new data set to train the chain of thoughts. You know, it's essentially a giant data set of, you
know, given task X, can you break it down and, uh, into, you know, break it down into parts? And you
know what's funny is this sort of rhymes with what Jake, uh, Heller figured out for case text—that
if a given task that you give an LLM is hallucinating or you know not consistently giving the output
you want, you're trying to make that particular prompt do too many things. You need to break it down
into steps. And so what's funny is Jake's prescription is really two parts, you know, one is break
it down into steps and then the other part is evals. And it sounds like basically with o1 the chain
of thoughts will replace the workflow so you might not need to break it down into steps yourself,
but the evals are still really important. Um, even like in the aftermath of that episode with Jake
Heller, it sounds like some YC alums are reaching out and saying that episode helped us figure out
and unlock something really big. Like a lot of people really were just raw dogging their prompts.

Harj Taggar: Yeah, they got to, uh, you have an example of the company you work with, J, that got to
100%?

Jared Friedman: Yeah, just by doing exactly what Jake recommended, which is like having a really big
eval set and being very careful about testing every step of your reasoning pipeline.

Harj Taggar: So one of the theories that I have now is ultimately, like, if you superimpose that on
what is a moat—I mean, that's one of the key questions that everyone's sort of asking themselves
right now, you know? Okay, like, GPT-5 is coming, two more orders, maybe four more orders of
magnitude are coming in terms of a trillion dollar spent on more training. That's pretty wild, you
know? If I'm a rapper company or I'm trying to do vertical SaaS or I'm trying to, you know, build my
own business, what do I do? My theory would be it's the evals. It's, you know, write the 10,000 test
cases. And the only way you get access to the test cases that are proprietary data that are not like
commonly available is that you literally, you know, that's what a bunch of our companies in this
current YC are doing. They're doing the hard work of doing enterprise sales. They're getting
embedded and sort of going quote-unquote undercover into these, uh, you know, sometimes really
boring jobs, sometimes really complex or arcane jobs, you know? It's everything from, you know, I
think accounts receivable all the way over to how do you do like financial accounting or forensic
accounting? Like it's just all kinds of things that are really, uh, not readily available. Um, you
could almost argue that anything that is consumer and publicly available on the internet that's
going to be in the base model. So then your moat ultimately is for all of the other things that are
not already online—whether it's, you know, for case text being a lawyer or maybe over here on
science or, you know, in terms of building airfoils—like what you're trying to find is the data that
is proprietary in some use case, some vertical that allows you to build that 10,000 test case, um,
eval. And then that's actually the value. I mean, this is just a crazy theory, but it's something
that might be what happens.

Jared Friedman: Totally. An interesting implication for startups based on everything you just said,
um, is it may be worth thinking about who, like, of your customers, picking the ones that will pay
you a lot for that final like 10%—like accuracy improvement, perfection. I think like Camper are
actually a good example of it where there's lots of interest in this sort of text-to-CAD design
amongst like hobbyists or people who want to prototype things and get something up and running very
very quickly. Um, but there's also like a segment of the market where it's people who are literally
designing like, you know, airplane parts where there is no room or like margin for error and o1
makes it quite easy or easier now, right, to get to like the prototype, like, you know, 80% of the
way there. But I think the strongest technical teams have the option to go all the way and go after
the segment of customers who want like a 100% accuracy and will pay a lot for it.

Gary Tan: Always go all the way.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, to go all the way. But I think it's interesting because one one of the things
that gets pushed is, does o1 or does AI in general actually make it commoditize a lot of the tech
and make it less important to be a strong technical team? And it just seems unlikely to me. It seems
like actually the last—it seems it's the opposite.

Gary Tan: Yeah, yes. Like all of the value is probably going to be captured by like the strongest
technical teams who can build on top of whatever the base level of tech is and get the final 10%.

Jared Friedman: Yeah. Gary, I think it's the prompts. It's the evals and it's also like the UI layer
and the integrations that go around it because like just the prompts themselves are not a product
for a company to actually adopt. Camper, like, it needs to actually integrate into their existing
tools. It needs to have a well thought-through UI and workflow and all the tooling to sort of make
the prompts useful.

Gary Tan: Yeah, well, and then it's distribution, right? Like, how do you actually get in front of
people? Do you establish your brand? And then a perfectly good moat is difficulty switching.
Actually, once you have all your data and it's working and you're paying $10,000 or $100,000
ACV—sometimes a million to 10 million ACV—uh, you know, man, it's going to be hard to switch. So all
the classic moats still apply, you know? This is still software. But you know, you can unlock this
capability. And you know, this is a moment. You know, another point to double down on the importance
of evals is that that still applies in the world of o1. As founders are wondering, how am I going to
still build the best product on top of it? Or o1 does it change? And everything we discussed in the
episode with Jake Keller applies because Giggle is this company that, uh, Harj, you work with?

Harj Taggar: Yep.

Gary Tan: Gary too, right? I adopted them. May tell us a bit about what they, what they do?

Harj Taggar: The full backstory is we funded them for a completely different, um, idea. Something
like they're an Indian founding team and the original idea was something helping Indian high school
students apply to US colleges—a very niche idea. But they're super cracked AI engineers,
researchers, yeah? And it just happened like we were like, this is not a great idea. AI is, you
know, changing the world and you like, your research like that you've been doing at university or
college is all aligned with like, um, in like fine-tuning LLM models. Originally it wasn't even the
AI version of helping Indian high school students apply to—nothing to do with AI. Actually, so it's
like a classic YC story—was like these are two clearly brilliant engineers, um, we don't like the
idea at all, but we should just fund them anyway and hope something works out. And the idea they
actually pivoted to initially, which they raised a seed round for, um, was helping companies fine-
tune, um, open-source models so they could get to like equivalent performance, um, uh, as you know,
at the time it was really only OpenAI. But, um, what I think in general what we found is that those
have not proven to be great businesses because just like the cost of the models has gone down and
also, like, you know, the performance of the open-source models has gone up, you just haven't had to
fine-tune as much as people thought you would need to because the models just keep getting better.
It's kind of betting on the opposite direction on AGI—that, let's just trust that these models are
going to keep getting better and better, which also doesn't require as much fine-tuning.

Gary Tan: Yeah.

Harj Taggar: And so they pivoted again into, well, like, let's just find a vertical, like, let's
just find like a—we're really good at AI now. We're like experts in like fine-tuning, squeezing
performance out of these models. So let's just like find a vertical application for that. And they
went into, um, AI customer support, which is like competitive. But again, I just think if you're an
intensely technical team you can still find ways to squeeze out like a comparative edge against
other teams in the space. And I think that's what they've done. The problem with customer support is
you're dealing with very kind of squishy problems. There's just so many edge cases. It's just the
space of things that could go wrong as a customer rep is enormous.

Gary Tan: Well, it seems competitive, but the thing is, hardly any adoption has actually happened.
Like, it's not like the world has replaced all the customer support agents with AI yet. We can all
see that it's going to happen, but it hasn't happened yet. And so from that standpoint, like, it's
wide open. What I, what I found at least when I spoke to the Giggle ML team last is that, um, part
of the reason for the lack of adoption is that rules-based systems work fairly well for most of the
simple cases and there's just not trust or belief that you can like build AI that's good enough to
solve like the real messy stuff. And so most companies that were pitched on like an AI customer
support agent were like, well, you can't actually go all the way and solve like the hardest problems
that take up most of the time. And the rules-based system works like totally fine for everything
else. And so I remember when they were first pitching this idea, people would just be like, this is
just overkill. We don't need it. A rules-based system works totally fine. But like, seems like that
is no longer the case.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, because they now have some really legit customers who's, uh, Zepto just signed
up?

Gary Tan: Okay, so last time I did office hours with them, they said that they automated 30,000
tickets per day and so they, you know, I think Zepto had more than a thousand people working, uh, on
those 30,000 tickets per day, which you know, 30 tickets a day and then, uh, the interesting thing
was, you know, on the one hand, you know, this is probably one of the things that frankly everyone
when they think about AI they're a little bit worried like, you know, are these jobs going to go
away? And, uh, the interesting thing about the Zepto customer support, uh, job is that it's so not a
fun job that I think the turnover rate was something like a few months—like, most customer support
agents only wanted to work there for, you know, six months or less. So you, this actually is an
interesting case of when you know, when something is incredibly rote, it's literally replacing
butter passing—like, these are sometimes not really actually good jobs. And, um, you know, hopefully
those people can go and do something way more awesome with their time and, you know, beautiful
brains, then you know, these rote jobs apologizing for Zepto orders that got misplaced.

Harj Taggar: Exactly right. But the crazy thing they figured out with o1 is that to your point,
harsh, their previous implementation before o1 was GPT Plus rules, and all that, and it would not be
able to handle most of the cases. It would have about a 70% error rate. Now what they did is doing
the technique like Jake Keller described with really going hardcore on the eval plus o1. During the
hackathon they got to only 5% error, which is an order of magnitude improvement.

Gary Tan: The other row in this is incredible too, right? This is what—saying like the complex, like
the things that are like very complicated that take up lots of time and are expensive to solve would
like essentially like they could not do them. Yeah, so basically just like 0% and that's what I'm,
that's what they were encountering when they were selling this is like, a lot of people like, well,
actually all of the stuff that we want to automate are these like complicated edge cases that waste
lots of time, um, and like they just they couldn't actually do any of that. But like now they're at
like 15% and that's with like o1 preview alone.

Jared Friedman: Oh, that's, is that 15% of just error? So now they're at like 85% accuracy?

Gary Tan: From Z to 85%, it went from 0% accuracy to 85% accuracy.

Harj Taggar: Yeah, so the interesting thing here is that o1—it's not even o1 yet, it's o1 preview.
And then, uh, it's such a new technique that they think they're trying to protect their advantage
right now. So, uh, you know, if you use o1 in ChatGPT, it looks like it will tell you what's really
going on. But apparently they have a fake model that just spits out things to give you the
impression that it's breaking it up into steps, and, uh, they've actually, you know, hidden it
because they don't want other people to have access to that data yet. Um, but the next step seems
like it needs to be some interpretability, some directability, and then for that to happen, you
know, I'd be curious if O2 ends up having that. Like, you want to be able to see okay, well, show me
the work. Show me the steps. And oh, like, that step, the third step—you know, can we rerun this but
I want this to branch in this way? Or edit it?

Jared Friedman: I think this is one of the things that would be the next unlock is, um, right now it
has the plan that it comes out the chain of thought. But you cannot edit it. So imagine now, right
now today, o1 just outputs whatever 15 steps to the problem that you need to solve. And imagine now
being able to edit each of the steps. Then you get into the super, super, uh, fine to next level of,
uh, Jake Heller.

Harj Taggar: So this is the, it's the worst that these models are ever going to be, right now, right
this moment. And you know, literally week to week, you know, there are things that you couldn't do
maybe a month ago that you could do really really well right now. So that sounds like a pretty crazy
moment in history.

Gary Tan: So we've been talking a lot about the kinds of companies and ideas that get this wave of
uplift from this model improvement for o1. What are the kinds of ideas that are the opposite—that
are not getting—

Gary Tan: ...benefited as much from O1, and perhaps maybe people even should pivot because they're
getting—they might just get deprecated from the improvements as O1, O2, O3. I wouldn't go all the
way and suggest they should pivot, but I do think companies that are building AI coding agents or AI
program engineers will potentially have stuff to think about here because it seems like O1 in
particular is like outperforming on just, you know, solving programming problems essentially. And I
certainly know some of the teams I work in the past, like a lot of what they've invested in is like
the Chain of Thought infrastructure behind this stuff, which is now just O1—doesn't—is not actually
like any leap forward for them. They've already invested in that already. And so I think that might
be a function of, um, basically the opaque nature of what the Chain of Thought is. And once you get
it to be directable, that's actually—I mean, frankly, that's what users and CEOs are struggling with
even right now. Like, once it starts going down a certain path, you can't really alter things. Like,
you want it to ask you, "Hey, do you want me to do it like this or that?" And you know, all of the
systems are a little bit struggling with that right now.

Host: I was going to ask the inverse question, Tyana, which is like each new model capability
unlocks a new set of startup ideas. Like, um, a year ago, doing startup ideas where the AI agent
would talk on the phone just didn't work. We had a bunch of companies that tried and all the
companies didn't work. And over the summer it really started working. And one of the trends from the
past few batches, like anything around like phone calling, is like blowing up right now because the
models finally work. So like, with this new O1 series of models, what are the startup ideas that
like just became possible?

Tyana: Connected to Sam's essay is a lot of things that are going to make the atom world, physical
world better because it's really good at math and physics. So any startup that's working around
mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, bioengineering—all of these
things that really will make our lives better. I think we are really getting an unlock, as we've
seen from the demos we highlighted, that's exciting. I mean, it can't just be helping people click a
little bit faster. It's got to be things that actually create real world abundance for everyone.
And, um, that it might just be a little bit of a race. Like, I think there's sort of the fear of AI
out there in society right now, and then, um, it's sort of up to the technologist to try to usher in
this age of abundance sooner rather than later. And if we can do that, then, um, abundance will win
out over fear.

Gary Tan: So with that, I think we're out of time for this week of the Lightcone. We'll see you guys
next time.
