## Transcript

Gary Tan: What is the state of these AI programmers? Like, is it reliable yet and where are we at?
Well, we just see software companies have way less employees and converge on a point where you could
have unicorns, billion dollar companies that have like ten people on them. If we imagine a world
where there could be companies less than ten employees, maybe you could still be a family, but is
that still a good idea? I have a controversial argument against what Jensen said. This one will
probably piss some people off.

Gary Tan: Nice. Welcome to another episode of the Lightcone. I'm Gary. This is Jared Harge and
Diana, and collectively we funded companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars. And today we're
talking about this one very controversial clip that lit up the internet from Jensen Hang. I'm going
to say something and it's going to sound completely opposite of what people feel.

Jensen Huang (clip): You probably recall over the course of the last ten, fifteen years, almost
everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that your children learn computer
science. Everybody should learn how to program. And in fact, it's almost exactly the opposite. It is
our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program. And the programming language
is human. Everybody in the world is now a programmer.

Gary Tan: So what do you guys think? Is this true? We're at the dawning of LLMs. We infused the
rocks with electricity and recently they learned how to talk and now they can code. What does it
mean? I guess the question is, are the next generation of founders, or young, or anyone who's young
looking to figure out what they want to do with their career, should they still study computer
science? Is that still a good bet in the long run? And a lot of us spent a long time telling people
over all these generations, "Yeah, you should learn to code. If you're a non-technical founder, you
should learn to code. It's like the most important thing to do during college. Like, definitely, no
matter what else you do, learn how to code." Right? So the question is whether LLMs and AI are just
going to automate all of these jobs. And I think we have different views on it, right? We funded a
couple, a number of companies that are actually building coding assistance that are taking tasks of
developers. And what does the future look like for that?

Gary Tan: I mean, I guess the analogy that you could say—I don't really agree with this, but you
could say that given photography, you didn't have to learn how to use a paintbrush in order to
create representations of real life. And today you can prompt using a diffusion model, you can
actually just write out what you want and an image will be developed for you. Will this transition
to code? And some of the questions that Diana has done a little bit of research on—and I think
Jared, you too—is, what is the state of these AI programmers? Like, is it reliable yet and where are
we at? Related to Jensen's clip is the launch of Devon, which also took the internet by storm and
has inspired many founders to go into this area, including a lot of the companies that we've funded
in the past two batches. It could be interesting to talk about that history and what the state-of-
the-art is with AI programmers.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, so right now these companies that I funded—with companies like Sweep, we also
work with Fume—a lot of them are solving a lot of tasks for more junior developers that have to do
with like fixing an HTML tag here or a bug here and there. That's fairly small, but it's a bit more
difficult when you want it to actually build more complex systems, like "build me the distributed
system of the backend that scales." That we cannot do today.

Jared Friedman: I think it's important to put context around Jensen's tweet. Like, three months ago,
basically AI could not program usefully at all. It was hitting like almost zero. And what really
changed? Um, I actually think it goes back to before Devon. I actually think the real unlock for the
current surge of interest in AI programmers goes back eight months ago to when the Princeton NLP
group released this benchmarking dataset called SWE-bench. And SWE-bench is a dataset of GitHub
issues taken from real programming problems. So it's a good representative dataset of real-world
programming tasks, the kind of things that programmers actually do. And this dataset finally made it
possible for people to really tackle this problem of building an AI programmer, try an algorithm,
benchmark it, and see how good it is, and compete with other people on the internet.

Jared Friedman: Diana and I were actually just talking about how, if you look back at the history of
machine learning, a lot of the big unlocks came from somebody publishing a benchmarking dataset.
Going back to the very beginning of deep learning.

Diana Hu: Do you want to talk about how deep learning actually got started? Really, yeah.

Diana Hu: So this benchmark, SWE-bench, is very reminiscent of ImageNet, which was a groundbreaking
dataset from the lab at Stanford from Fei-Fei Lee. And it was a very challenging dataset, one of the
biggest that had a lot of images and lots of classes where the task for an algorithm was to classify
and see what the image was. Because at the time, like the biggest unsolved problem in machine
learning—this is hard to believe—was like, to get a computer to look at a picture of a cat and be
able to tell you, "This is a picture of a cat." That was like totally intractable in 2006, because a
cat can have lots of variations. It's actually a very hard problem because you have cats that are
yellow, they're black, they could be in different positions, they could be sleeping, they could be
laying down, and they all look very different. But how do you encode that when you have limited data
sets?

Diana Hu: So before 2006, the traditional methods in machine learning were more statistical. You
would do things where, more discriminant, you would have things like support vector machines. You
would use things with feature extraction that were hand-coded signal processing feature extractors,
and putting things in like the frequency domain or all these sorts of things that people tried—or
wavelets, whatever. And people tried it and that dataset was really hard. The error rate was like
really, really high, like over thirty to forty percent.

Diana Hu: And for a bit of context, human perception on this dataset is about five percent accuracy,
more or less.

Jared Friedman: Error rate.

Diana Hu: Error rate. Correct. Five percent error rate. And then all these standard methods were
like fifty percent or more. Like, thirty percent above. So which is really bad. It's like way, way
worse.

Diana Hu: So then came about AlexNet, right?

Jared Friedman: Yep. A group from the University of Toronto. And they had trained a deep learning
net using GPUs. And it was one of the first cases of people training deep learning networks using
GPUs. AlexNet blew the performance of everybody else out of the water. It was way better than all
the other techniques. And I remember the day that news article dropped. It took the programming
internet by storm. I would argue that the AI race that we're in right now is—we're literally still
riding the wave that was kicked off by AlexNet in 2012. Like, it just kicked off this incredible
race.

Diana Hu: Yeah. It was the first time that at that point it was getting to human-level perception.
Then people found this phenomenon of stacking neural nets with lots of layers. People didn't exactly
know what was happening in the middle. People treated it like this black box, but it was actually
starting to work.

Diana Hu: So the interesting learning from this lesson is that SWE-bench is that moment in time
where we can measure something and then we can get better at it. Because before, with ImageNet,
there wasn't a big enough dataset to do that. So we will make progress in terms of programming. But
now the question is, are we going to get to the point where we're going to get AI algorithms that
are just as good as programming with humans?

Jared Friedman: Is coding like an image recognition task? One of the reasons this wouldn't
happen—because, so far, like, if you zoom out, you have programming as one of the most promising
early use cases for LLMs since they've launched, essentially, right? You have GitHub Copilot, which
really was a co-pilot for programmers. Data, compute, everything is scaling. The models keep getting
better. Um, we now have, like you said, a benchmark and human attention and focus on trying to make
this better. Like, what are the reasons we won't just—this isn't just a straight scaling law?

Jared Friedman: Oh, I think we will. We're now at like fourteen percent on SWE-bench. That's like
the state-of-the-art performance, and it's still well below human performance. I'm not sure what
human performance would be, but certainly a skilled programmer could probably solve most of SWE-
bench given enough time. So like, I think the SWE-bench mark is going to go—I think we're going to
see rapid improvements for the reasons that Diana mentioned. But SWE-bench—it's a collection of
small bugs in existing repositories, which is quite different from like building a new thing from
scratch. And so even when we get to a thing that can solve, you know, half of SWE-bench, that's
still pretty far from something where you could just give it instructions for an app to build and it
could just go build the whole app.

Gary Tan: Yep. I mean, the way I think about it—those was kind of what my question is really. SWE-
bench, the kind of tasks that are in SWE-bench, are analogous to image recognition? But I think
programming falls in a different kind of category of problems that it can solve. It is a bigger set
because SWE-bench is like a subset. It's still like in this idealized world. And maybe to put a bit
of context, I think in terms of engineering, there's two categories of problems and how we model the
world. There's sort of the design world that is all like perfect, where you have all the perfect
engineering tolerances, all the simulation data, and all the laws of physics work perfect in that
simulated world. And then you have reality, which is messy.

Gary Tan: I think the world of AI, LLMs, and all that—I think they do a good job with this design
world. But when you encounter real-world stuff, a lot of stuff breaks. And you end up with—when I
was working and building all these engineering systems—hot fixes that come in. And it's like random
magic numbers to make the system work. Or like, you could imagine with all the self-driving cars.
I'm pretty sure there's a lot of magic numbers because it's just the placement of sensors that,
like, messes with physics. You have all these coefficients of friction, and they're not pretty.
Like, the laws of physics like Newton—they're like beautiful equations in this ideal world. But in
the real world, when you need to get systems to work, like engineering and systems for startups,
they solve real problems you encounter friction. And there's all sorts of coefficients of friction
that, depending on all the materials, that world is infinite. So my argument is that I don't think
LLMs are going to be able to really encompass and really manage the whole real world. The real world
is like infinite.

Jared Friedman: Are you, like, going to the Jensen original video? You're basically saying, like,
basically the dream situation is you type in, "I want an app that helps me share blah blah blah
photos," yeah? And the software just magically figures out how to build it?

Gary Tan: Yeah. And I guess one way, like, to build on that analogy—like, if I think about the world
that Jensen was envisioning, it was a world in which programmers are like product managers today. If
you think about a product manager, a product manager basically builds an application by writing
English, right? They write a spec and then programmers go and they translate that into like working
code. And so maybe in the future, that's how apps will be built—is you'll just like write English
and the AI will take care of the translation, which I think gets into like the heart of a debate
that has always happened amongst engineers and non-engineers in Silicon Valley, which is how much of
programming is an implementation thing. It's just, hey, like, you have the idea and the
implementation are separate, versus actually, like, you only get the ideas in the process of
implementing. And Paul Graham is a huge proponent of the latter, right? Like, in multiple ways.
Like, in programming, it's like the whole reason he's such a proponent of Lisp from the early days
is you want a very flexible language because you only get the good ideas once you start building.

Jared Friedman: And his philosophy actually translates over to writing, where writing is literally
thinking.

Gary Tan: Yeah. Your process of actually writing is thinking. And I remember when I was learning how
to do YC interviews, watching him and being in the room with him, and asking him like, "Well, how do
you know exactly what are you looking for?" And one thing that he disabused me of was, sometimes
people would come in and I'd look at, you know, what they did in the past, and you know, I generally
felt like, "Well, this looks like someone who's smart and with it and they did some impressive
things in the past. Surely they thought through this and they just didn't say it in the meeting."
And one of the things Paul would always say is like, "Oh, no, no, no. If they don't say it, then
they themselves do not know. Like, the writing is actually thinking."

Gary Tan: And I guess to sort of torture this analogy—but I kind of like it—that we have we're sort
of in this moment where, if we take the analogy of like the camera, like, made it so that you don't
have to paint anymore, the subtlety there is that aesthetics in the world still exist. And I think
the artistry of creating software or technology products is actually in that interface between the
human and the technology itself. So my argument would be, if you're doing backend software and
you're writing APIs and models, um, that might get a lot of help from these types of AI programmers,
right? Like, you can actually strongly type this stuff and then you can actually use language to
translate that into saying what the product should actually do. But there is still an artistry in
that interface of what should actually even do and how.

Diana Hu: I think that's a very good point, Gary. I think maybe the other thing way to think about
this, with LLMs and programming, if you think about the history of computer science and programming
languages, as we progress, we became more and more in higher language abstractions. So we started,
in the early days, it was just very, very much like coding in assembly, yes? And it would take like
so many lines of code to just do addition, right? Then you went up and did things like with Fortran,
and then C++, where you had to really know about the metal still and manage your own memory. Then
you went into things with more dynamically typed languages where you didn't have to think about the
type, like JavaScript and Python, right? Or duck typing, right? And now this is like a new thing
with programming with English. But you still need the artistry and craftsmanship to come up with the
design and the architecture.

Diana Hu: And interestingly, the best programmers today, even if they are programming in Python,
they've learned C, and they actually like know a lot about how computers work, like how the steps
below the stack work, even if they're using the higher abstraction.

Jared Friedman: I was curious to ask everyone here, like, another potential counter-example is the
natural language to SQL idea that has been around for years and years and has never really taken
off. And I always wondered how much of that is because it's hard to build and implement, and how
much of it is because it's actually like, it's not as simple as just, "I need someone to translate
my thoughts into a SQL query." It's knowing like the right questions to ask about the data and like
having...

Jared Friedman: I have a controversial argument against what Jensen said. This one will probably
piss some people off.

Host: Nice.

Jared Friedman: My argument is that even if everything that Jensen predicts comes true and in the
future you will be able to build a great app just by writing English, you should still learn how to
code because learning how to code will literally make you smarter. We have an interesting piece of
evidence for this, which is there's a lot of studies now that show that the way LLMs learn to think
logically is by reading all the code in GitHub and basically learning how to code. And I think
programmers have long suspected that this, that learning how to code made them smarter, but it was
kind of hard to prove with humans. And now we have some actual evidence that this is really true.

Host: There's definitely some evidence that for some certain class of problems with LLMs, you're way
better off having the LLM write code to solve the problem than to try to solve the problem itself.

Jared Friedman: Exactly. Yeah, so tool use is actually a very weird emergent behavior and property
of these systems. Summing up, it's like, okay, let's say that one thing is probably uncontroversial:
there is absolutely going to be some sunset of programming work that will just be subsumed by LLMs.
Maybe it's going to be junior engineering work, like glue code, a whole bunch of certain type of
programming work. We can all admit does not involve high creativity, high human reasoning. I should
worry more about all the death shocks where all this stuff gets like outsourced. That type of stuff
that gets outsourced to dev shops or even like FAANG companies that have like armies of junior
employees. And so one potential consequence of that is if we're not that far away from the junior AI
software engineer, is will we just see software companies have way less employees and converge on a
point where you could have unicorns, billion dollar companies that have like 10 people on them?

Host: Sam Altman had a recent comment about this that also went kind of viral on the internet, the
idea that in the future, unicorns could have 10 employees or fewer. Which is only, well, it's never
quite happened, I think. WhatsApp and Instagram are probably the closest to that ever happening.

Host: Yeah, it feels like we've always had this as a thought for the last decade plus at Silicon
Valley, and we've always had flashes of, oh, like Instagram gets bought for a billion dollars with
like 20 employees, WhatsApp gets bought for 13 billion dollars with 15 employees or whatever the
numbers are. But we've never seen like a sustained trend that we can point to. It's always like
these flashes. But maybe now we're at the point where we will just see a trend.

Host: It's interesting. I feel like people who are new to Silicon Valley and new to being founders,
they want to have more employees because employees are like correlated with status essentially.

Host: Yeah, and we know the like more experienced founders who've been doing this for a while, they
are obsessed with this idea of having fewer employees, having as few as possible. Because after once
you like manage a large company with lots of employees, you realize how much it sucks. And that's
why everyone, that's why this meme has been around in Silicon Valley for a long time.

Host: Yeah, it feels like there's often two types of people who really push for and are motivated
for this smaller employee idea or smaller teams idea. It's that profile, and then it's also just
engineers who are naturally more inclined towards like computers versus people, don't are not
excited about the idea of like managing lots of people.

Host: Which totally, the Paul Graham thing, like he was into this in 2005, long before it was like a
trend in in Silicon Valley.

Host: Yep, and it had to be a combination of foresight and personal preference, right? Like just not
wanting to be like in an office with hundreds of people.

Host: I met up with Mark Pincus from Zynga here at YC recently, and the most interesting thing he
told me was, I think at some point a company gets to about a thousand people, and even the most
forceful, the most sort of with it CEO, you sort of lose the capability to really impose your will
on the company right around when 1,000 people. And if I reflect on some of the founders that we
interact with sort of regularly who have thousands of employees, like that's actually sort of what
their daily lived experience is like. There these things that you know, you know are sort of
extremely true, the company must go in this direction, and then even then you're like a little bit
boxed in and you're like unable to enforce that.

Host: I have to say, I feel like of founders I work with, especially some of the younger, hardcore
technical engineers, I think they actually grow into the leading bigger teams and just viewing
people as a resource that should be used well. Example: I can have like Patrick Houlison of Stripe.
I worked with him on our first startup together when he was like 19, and he was definitely the sort
of archetype of incredibly intense engineer who wanted to be working on hard engineering problems
all the time and viewed too many people around as like a distraction from like the core work, to not
want to be hiring people and don't want to be doing any of this stuff. At some point, I think once
he started Stripe, like something changed where he realized that the way to achieve like his
ambitions was to just take an engineering mind, like view the company as like another product that
needs to be like engineered and built, and people are a core component of that. And I think he just
embraced the I need to be a very effective leader, hire and manage people. And so I'm not saying in
this new AI world Stripe wouldn't have less employees if it would started today, but I don't think
he would have this internal motivation to be like, I need to just not hire anyone so much anymore.
It just be like more of like an expected value calculation of what is it better for me to ultimately
do, or is it better for me to like rally people and use them as a resource? What do you all think?

Host: I mean, these are hard things for a young founder to sort of approach, and actually these are
sort of some of the reasons why my startup didn't go as far as I wanted it to. I think the maybe
most toxic, or you know, difficult thing that I struggled with was this idea that like, somehow your
startup is your family. And you know, there's actually a clip online of, um, I think Brian Chesky of
Airbnb in a prior era, actually like, you know, saying that relatively emphatically. And then today,
if you ask him, he would say, "Oh, no, no, no, this is definitely not a family." A family has all
these old, weird traumas. Like, imagine you know, bringing home a boyfriend or girlfriend and
they're like sitting with your family and you know they go back and they're like, "Well, what
happened there? Like, why is that?" It's like, "Oh, you don't want to ask. You know, let's not ask
about that, right?" Like, you don't want to. Having a family be your model of a company is actually
kind of a bad thing. And the much more functional version of it is actually a sports team. Like,
"Here's actually what we're trying to do, and you know, basically we need to win." I think wanting
to win is sort of the ideal analogy, whereas you know, for family, there's these weird things like,
"Oh, we just want love." And I was like, "Oh, no, no, that's not what a company is for. That's not
what a startup is for. We're here to solve problems and win."

Host: I guess I really wish that I had someone tell me that when I was, you know, sort of 27, going
through my first stint at YC.

Host: I think that's a hard transition. I personally went through that because we went from very
small engineering team to a very large one once we went through Niantic with Pokémon GO. And all of
that hyper success with Pokémon GO is very jarring when you go from that small, intimate team and go
into like an engineering org of like 500 people. It really, that that that concept of going from
this is your tribe and people and family, where where you really know each other and everyone, to
getting the best, the best performance out of everyone is very different. And that's hard. And what
could be interesting with this era, where if we imagine a world where there could be companies with
less at 10 employees, maybe you could still be a family. But is that still a good idea?

Host: I don't actually believe that's what this episode is about, talking about is, Jared, to your
point of like programming just sort of makes you smarter. Um, there's certainly some kind of
learning founders go through when they hire people, build teams, deal with conflict, fire people,
learn how to get the most out of them. Um, that probably just makes them more effective overall.
Like, maybe smart is not the word, but like certainly makes you more effective figuring out how to
work well with people and get the best out of them.

Host: Yes, you you learn a lot about people in the process of having to build a company and a team.

Host: Yeah, and I I was thinking about what you said, Harj, about Patrick Houlison and how he went
from being a programmer to like learning how to run a company. And I was realized like that's that's
not just Patrick Houlison. That's actually like all of our best founders are like exactly like that.
And sometimes people wonder how we can fund like you know, 18-year-olds with no prior management
experience and expect them to build a big company someday. And it's exactly that. It's because they
treat it like an engineering problem.

Host: Yeah, actually, and that's where you get back to the sort of programmers are the small set
basically. It's like, can you actually just treat everything as a programming problem? It all just
starts with video games and then learning to code. So that's sort of the path.

Host: This is something I take away from. I read the Larry Ellison Oracle biography and like a bunch
of nuggets from there, but like one really interesting one is there's a period in time where he
completely ignored just like the finance function at the company because he thought it was the most
boring thing in the world. And then Oracle went through a near-death experience where they weren't
on top of their budgets and expenses and just almost ran out of money. And he like forced himself to
have to get on top of it so they would not die from running out of money again. And like the only
way he could do it was to be like, "Okay, this is just like I'm going to treat this like a
programming problem. Like it's just numbers, it's process, like I'm just going to optimize this as
though I would like coding." And he got really into it and just actually started really enjoying the
whole process of process optimization. Which then fed back into Oracle in a weird way because
Oracle's business was a lot of like going to companies, figuring out which of their processes were
messy, and trying to sell them software to like solve it. He experienced the problem himself and
then he built the solution that he wanted, and then he was able to sell that solution to everybody
else because everyone else had the same problem.

Host: Basically, but again, it all came from like an engineer who wanted to avoid a messy, people
process problem just taking it on and treating it like a programming problem and actually becoming
more effective at it than like the team that was built to work on it.

Host: I see this a lot with our technical founders, our technical program with our technical
founders who are doing B2B companies where they treat their sales org this way. They definitely
treat sales like a programming optimization problem.

Host: Yep, it's like stereotypical actually.

Host: So what do we think the net effect of this is going to be overall? If AI you know makes us all
more productive, if AI can start taking away some of the junior programming work, do we see a lot
more unicorns? Does it make it possible for one company to become worth like a trillion dollars? Or
do we see like a long tail of lots of like unicorns started by much smaller teams? And do we think
the teams will even shrink? Because um, if we go back to predictions in the early 2000s, there were
a lot of people who were predicting that as programming got more efficient, companies would be
smaller. Because in the 90s, to build an internet startup, you had to build everything yourself. You
had to build, you had to have people who knew how to rack servers. You had to hire people who knew
how to optimize databases. You had to hire like people to run payroll. And then all of that stuff
got like turned into like SaaS services or infrastructure or open source. And so like you could
focus on just your core competency. And there were a lot of people who were predicting that this
meant that companies would have fewer employees because they wouldn't need all those people that you
needed in the past.

Host: I remember racking servers, but I bet a lot of people watching this have never even stepped
foot in, don't even know what that phrase means. What is a you know what's a rack? Like how does
that even work? You just go and you know click a button on a website and like boom, I have a server,
right? Like that's how it works, right?

Host: Yeah, and before REST we're looking at some data earlier, and what we discovered is, is I, it
didn't happen actually. Like companies didn't get smaller. And Harj discovered the reason why.
There's this concept in economics called the Jevons Paradox stocks, which is essentially once you
make any um service more efficient, like you make it cheaper to deliver, you increase demand for it.
And so you actually just get more consumption. And like examples would be Excel spreadsheets making
it easier to do financial analysis did not decrease the number of financial analysts. It actually
just like increased them. I think typewriters being replaced by word processors is kind of another
example of where yes, the strict role of being a typist and a typewriter away, but the demand for
people with word processing skills went way up. So software became cheaper to make, but as
programmers became more efficient, but it did not reduce the demand for programmers. It actually
increased the demand for programmers. Which I think we actually see it in the number of uh companies
applying to YC. There was this essay from PG just 15 years ago that he he couldn't imagine the world
where we'd have more than 10,000.

applications per year. And at this point, we're getting over 50,000 applications per year. More than
that, it is becoming easier to start companies more than ever because there's so much infrastructure
built. But at the same time, the requirements to be good at it and be a good founder are higher. I
think it requires having even better taste and more craftsmanship to become the best founder now,
right?

Speaker: Yeah, sometimes we joke that if we went through YC now in our younger self, would we have
gotten it? It's actually very competitive now because the baseline is just so much higher.

Host: Yep. So there's this thing that at the end, you still need a computer science degree and
engineering degree to really build that taste and craftsmanship, to really know what to build and
build it well. You need to whisper to the AI and LLM. But how do you even whisper to it? You don't
know how all this stuff works.

Speaker: There's this amazing Rick and Morty meme where there's a little robot on the table passing
butter. And he goes up to Rick, the master. He's like, "What is my purpose?" And it says, "You pass
butter." And then he goes, "Oh my God." And the funniest thing about that is, like, you know,
there's so many people in the world who basically have that job. And they're not like robots,
they're human beings. You know, like their nine to five is something that is incredibly rote and not
that invigorating or exciting to them. And yet that's like sort of their entire lives. And how could
we not celebrate the fact that now we have more software, more tooling, potentially robotics coming
around the way? Like that might free that person from having to pass butter. And they can go off and
do something else, something more creative. Like, ideally, maybe they learn to code. Maybe they
learn to actually create things way off on the side in areas that OpenAI or, you know, sort of
Microsoft or, like, whoever the tech giants are, like those companies can't do everything. They
probably shouldn't do everything. Not only that, it's not clear to me that Lina Con will allow that.
So, you know, given that, actually, maybe that's the opportunity. Like, rather than just a few
companies worth a trillion dollars, my, you know, my genuine hope—and I think that we're trying to
manifest this world—is actually thousands of companies worth a billion dollars or more. And, you
know, some of those might have a thousand employees. Some of them might only have ten. Some of them
might even be just one founder sitting there doing that thing. But at the end of the day, ultimately
making it better for a real customer, a real problem, a real thing in society, that frees someone
from being a butter-passing robot. That's a human.

Host: I think this is such a good point, Gary. And I one hundred percent agree with that. I think
part of it is we're in this world of post-abundance of sorts where it's easier to build things. It's
easier to get the infrastructure up and running if you get the right opportunity. And there's a lot
of capital too if you know where to tap. But the bottleneck is: can you enable this equation of
human capital to flourish and match that opportunity and get the smart people that can do it and
have a lot of ambition in front of this capital? And this is why, right now, our job is one of the
coolest. We get to do that and enable this flourishment of a lot of people that maybe have been
passed in different situations and give them a chance to build these companies that will go against
the trillion-dollar ones, right? Just a thousand billion-dollar companies.

Speaker: We have all definitely lived through and hugely benefited from this trend of the more
powerful technology becomes, the easier it is to get a company off the ground. Clearly, like, just
open-source software—I mean, I just think back to even when Jared and I first moved here. Rails was
first taking off, and that was a huge innovation.

Host: Yeah, oh, that made me feel so powerful because before I had to use Java, and it was so
disempowering, right? You had Rails and you had Heroku kind of like come in and just make it easy
to, like, deploy and do, like, you know, you could be your own CIS admin essentially. And so I just
think that we all—that clearly made it easier for anybody to get their company off the ground. It
didn't necessarily mean these companies got much smaller. We didn't get like lots of ten-person
unicorns. But we certainly got a wider net of people who could prove out that they had an idea that
people wanted with early signs of traction, which then is what you need to attract like the human
capital and the actual capital to go out and scale these things. So I think even if we end up in a
world where AI is not going to be able to build like your perfect complex distributed system and
scale to like a hundred million active users, even if it means slightly more people can take their
idea and turn it into something and get it off the ground and get their first thousand users or
their first bit of revenue, the human capital will come, the actual financial capital will come, and
we'll just get more of these things, which is great for everyone.

Speaker: I love that, Harj. And I think that—that's one prediction I think we can definitely agree
is going to come true. And how cool that is because there must be so many great ideas that just
never get off the ground because the person who has the idea just kind of can't go zero to one, you
know, to getting that flywheel going or getting in front of the right people. I felt very lucky that
I grew up in jail in the middle of this desert. There's like nobody really worked on computers. And
they were just in the internet. And going through YC was one of those moments that changed my life
and the trajectory of it and really uplifted it. And I hope that happens for a lot more people that
we can work with.

Host: Well, so it sounds like the verdict is in: learn to code.

Speaker: Yes, you should learn to code. Sorry, Jensen is brilliant, but he is not right every single
time. I think one thing that is uncontroversial is that over the last ten years there have been more
unicorns started each year, right? Like, and that's been because technology has made it more
possible for people to get their ideas off the ground. I think AI only accelerates that trend,
right? I think we should just expect to see more unicorns started per year than ever because it is
easier to go from getting your idea to like a prototype to your first users than it ever has been.
And at the same time, it still table stakes to be able to program and code because so much of the
foundation knowledge you have to have good taste to build something great. And you only get the good
taste by going and studying engineering and computer science. The most important thing to me that I
really want to manifest in the world that I think we get to do all the time at Y Combinator is that
there are people here who are craftspeople or who could be craftspeople. And those are the people
who are going to go on to build the future.

Host: So with that, we'll see you next time.
