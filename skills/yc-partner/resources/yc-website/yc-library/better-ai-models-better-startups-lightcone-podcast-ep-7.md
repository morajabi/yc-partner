## Transcript

Gary Tan: Every time there's an OpenAI product release now, it feels like there's a bunch of
startups waiting with bated breath to see whether OpenAI is going to kill their startup. This is
actually a really crazy moment for all startups. Adding more types of modalities and more
capabilities per model, the better off every startup is. You have to be on top of these
announcements and kind of know what you're going to build in anticipation of them before someone
else does, versus being worried about OpenAI or Google being the ones to build them.

Gary Tan: Welcome back to another episode of the Lightcone. I'm Gary. This is Jared Harge and Diana,
and we're some of the group partners at YC who have funded companies that have gone on to be worth
hundreds of billions of dollars in aggregate. And today we are at an interesting moment in the
innovation of large language models in that we've seen a lot of really new tech come out just in the
last few weeks, whether it's GPT-4O, it's Gemini 1.5.

Jared Harge: How are you thinking about, you know, what does it mean for these models to be so much
better? Anytime I see a new announcement from one of the big AI companies with the release of a new
model, the first thing I think about is what does this mean for the startups, and in particular YC
startups. And when I was watching the OpenAI demos, it was pretty clear to me that they are really
targeting consumer. Like, all of the demos were cool consumer use cases and applications, which
makes sense. That's kind of what ChatGPT was, a consumer app that went really viral. I just wonder
what it means for the consumer companies that we're funding, and in particular, like, how will they
compete with OpenAI for these users?

Jared Harge: What did you think? Like, even if we take it back, like, how do consumer products win
from like first principles? Like, is it more about the product or the distribution? And how do you
compete with OpenAI on either of those things?

Diana Hu: Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, I think ultimately it's both. And then how I want
it to be is that the best product wins. How it actually is, is whoever has the best distribution and
a sufficiently good product seems to win. Either way, I actually think we're at sort of a moment
where the better the model becomes. If you're already using four and suddenly four—you know, you can
change one line of code and suddenly be using 4O. You basically just get smarter by default every
generation, and that's really, really powerful. It means that I think we're entering this moment
where the IQ of these things is still, you know, four is arguably around 85. It's not that high. And
then if the next generation, if Claude 3 really is at 100, or you know, the next few models end up
being closer to, you know, 110, 120, 130—this is actually a really crazy moment for all startups.
And the most interesting thing is, like, adding new capabilities. So having the same model be great
at coding, for instance. That means that, you know, you might have a breakthrough in reasoning, not
through just the model reasoning itself, but you could have the model actually write code and have
the code do better. And even right now, it seems like there's a lot of evidence that if instead of
trying to prompt the model to do the work itself, you have it write code and you execute the code,
it can actually do things that reasoning alone could not do.

Diana Hu: So adding more types of modalities and more capabilities per model, the better off every
startup is. I mean, the cool thing about 4O is that you can get better structured output. In this
particular case, they are better at getting JSON, which is getting signs of getting large language
models not just outputting English but more language for computers. So that you can build even
better applications on top, which is signaling that this better model can be better for startups and
make it easier to integrate. Because one of the challenges for startups has been always coaxing LLMs
to output the right thing so you can actually process it in regular business logic.

Jared Harge: The other thing I kind of thought about when I was looking at the demos is as it
relates to startups. If only one of these companies has the most powerful model by some distance,
then that is indeed bad for startups because you have to depend on them being friendly and having
like a nice API for you to build on top of. If there are multiple equivalently powerful models,
you're much safer off as a startup.

Jared Harge: It was funny, maybe coincidental, maybe not, that like OpenAI announcement was like
what, two days before? One day? One day before Google's, right?

Host: Um, what's the difference between, so under the hood, the way that GPT-4O works and then
Gemini 1.5 works? And do you have any opinions on their relative strengths?

Diana Hu: Yeah, so the thing about 4O, why it was so interesting, it was adding the speech modality
and also video processing on top of text. And the way they do that is still primarily a text-based
transformer model underneath, basically GPT-4. And what they done is bootstrap and added modules so
that it has different paths to handle this different type of data. OpenAI famously also implemented
and launched Whisper, which is one of the state-of-the-art for automatic speech recognition. And
probably that's what they're doing. They took the architecture of Whisper and then bolted it into
GPT-4. And they also bolted DALL-E, and they combined these and that became 4O. So this is why in
terms of the reasoning capabilities, 4O isn't better per se than four by any margin. So it's how it
works, it's kind of adding modules. How they describe it on the white paper, the difference versus
Gemini 1.5, which actually on the technical aspects and merits, I'm actually more excited by the
Gemini one. I know it's counterintuitive because 4O and OpenAI has captured the zeitgeist of
everyone, and they're so good at the demos, right? Singing Happy Birthday, a bit off key, that's
like so humanoid.

Diana Hu: Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday, dear Jan. Happy Birthday, to
Jordan. Google IO kind of missed the mark in terms of demo, but in terms of reading their white
paper, what's interesting about Gemini 1.5 is that it is actually a true mixture of experts. And
that is a technique that's new where they actually train from the ground up a giant model with the
actual data of text, image, audio, and the whole network activates a specific path for these
different data types. So instead of the OpenAI model that has like kind of modules, this one truly
is a one unified model. And what it does is different parts of the network activate depending on the
data input. So it becomes very energy efficient. And I think the reason why Google was able to do it
is because they have the engineering hammer. They have TPUs where they can really afford to put a
lot of data, because it's very expensive to put not just all text, image, and video and train this
giant thing in a distributed cluster. They have TPU, like their fifth generation now, and it's
pretty cool. What they done is that the first big model release that's using mixture of experts, I
think they talked a bit about it in the previous panel, but everyone was a bit disappointed after
the demo of the duck was not real.

Audience Member: It is a duck.

Diana Hu: Yes. But this one was described better. I mean, the interesting thing is that I think this
time they learned their lesson. And I think it is actually working.

Gary Tan: Yeah, and the other cool thing about Gemini is it has a context window of a million
tokens, which is huge. The GPT-4O is 128,000, so imagine what you can do with that. Because that's
about like five books of 500 words or more. And the cool thing about the Gemini 1.5 was their white
paper has to saying that on research they proved it to work on a 10 million token window. Which
brings a question for all of you: what does that mean for startups, especially a lot of the startups
that we're funding with infrastructure that do a lot of RAG?

Gary Tan: There could be the controversial argument that all these startups building tooling around
RAG, which is a whole industry right now, maybe they become obsolete. What do you all think about
that?

Diana Hu: I feel like the people who care a lot about data privacy and where the data is stored are
still going to want some sort of RAG system, right? Like they want the data stored somewhere they
control it versus all in the context window. It's not clear that that's going to be the biggest part
of the market. Like in general, people who care this much about any behind-the-scenes architectural
thing tend to be like early adopters, but not like mass market consumer. So my guess is people just
want like a massive context window because then you can start building the kinds of consumer apps
people are excited about, right? Like the assistant that just has all this context on me that knows
everything about me.

Diana Hu: Like, currently I think the best way you can do that is you like run Ollama or one of
these open source models, and then you like throw a bunch of your like personal emails at it. That's
like a project that the hobbyists on Reddit are doing a lot—is just try and get like your personal
AI that's got all the information on you. But if you had like an infinite context window, you
wouldn't need to do all of that. I think you'd still need RAG to be able to sort of store
everything. And that's like sort of the long-term permanent memory. And then what you actually want
is a separate workflow to pull out the interesting things about that user and their intentions. And
then you actually have a little like summary bullet point of things that you know about the user.

Gary Tan: You can actually kind of see some version of this even now in ChatGPT. If you go into the
settings under 4O, it actually now has a memory. And so you can actually see a concrete version of
this inside ChatGPT. I was just using it to sort of generate some like Where's Waldo images for my
son, and it wasn't quite doing what I wanted. It kept using, like, making like really deformed
faces. So I kept like prompting it back to back. I was like, "No, no, no, I really want no deformed
faces." And then for a while, it was like, "Uh, I said I wanted a red robot in the corner," and it
kept making all of the characters like various forms of red. And I said, "No, no, no, I really don't
want you to do it." And I, you know, sort of repeated it four or five times. And then I went and
looked at my settings, and it was like, "Gary really doesn't want deformed faces in his AI-generated
images. We should also try not to use red." It was interesting to see that, like, literally from
even like maybe 10 or 15 different chat interactions, you know, I was getting frustrated, but it was
definitely sort of developing some sort of memory based on my experience with it.

Gary Tan: And the most interesting thing was that you could see what the machine had like sort of
pulled out from your interactions thus far, and you could like sort of delete it as necessary.

Jared Harge: Maybe an infinite window doesn't necessarily mean that the retrieval is actually
accurate.

Diana Hu: Yeah, and this is more, I mean, more anecdotal in practice from what founders have told us
versus what the actual research paper benchmark is, which is a very kind of lab setting. So in
practice, I do tend to agree that a RAG pipeline infrastructure is still very much needed. Exactly
for what you said: privacy and people wanting to fine-tune models on their own data and not getting
that licked out over the wire, over the internet. And the other thing is, um, yeah, maybe it's still
more accurate to do it on your own when you really want that very precise information. I think you
still need RAG.

Jared Harge: And I think the analogy I like to think about this is sort of like processors back in
the day in the 90s as Moore's Law was actually Moore's Law scaling. It was not just a CPU processing
speed getting faster but also memory cache levels were also getting bigger and bigger. But now more
than 30 years later, we still have a very complex architecture with how we do different kinds of
caching for retrieving data out of databases. You have maybe like a fast memory store with like
Redis for high availability, and then you still have things stored in your browser cache. There's
still very much lots of layers of how things will be cached. And I think RAG is going to be this
foundational thing that will stay. And it'll be like how we work with databases normally now. Just
like lots of levels.

Diana Hu: Yeah, yeah. The tricky thing about the context window, I mean, Gemini may have the team
may have already fixed this by now, but certainly a lot of the founders I talked to, they said, uh,
it's sort of, you know, the million token context window sort of lacks specificity. Literally, if
you ask for retrieval from its own context window, from, you know, or the prompt, it actually
sometimes just like can't seem to recall it or can't seem to, you know, pick out the specific thing
that you already fed into it. And the tricky thing there is like you'd rather have a 128k context
window that you knew was pretty rock solid rather than a system where you know it's still a bit of a
black box. You don't really know what's going on, and then for all you know, it's just like sort of
randomly picking up like half a million of the tokens. And that, you know, again, like probably
fixable. You know, I can't imagine that that's like a permanent situation for, you know, a million
or 10 million token context window. But something that we're seeing from the field, for now also in
enterprises like in business use cases, people care a lot about like what specific data is being
retrieved, who's doing it, like logging all of this stuff, and permissioning around data. So yeah,
you can imagine having some kind of, yeah, a giant context window is not necessarily what you want
in an enterprise use case. You actually probably want, in particular, sensitive data stored
somewhere else and retrieved like when it's needed, and know who's making the requests and filter it
appropriately.

Gary Tan: Exactly. I think that will stay.

Jared Harge: I was really encouraged what you said actually, about how the Google technology is
maybe better than the OpenAI itself. It feels very Googly, actually. It's like, "Hey, they've got
the technology, but they just like don't know how to get like the polish around it."

Gary Tan: Correct. That means OpenAI does not have this like leap forward unseizable tech advantage.
If Google has something comparable, then we should expect to see like Anthropic come in. We should
expect to see like Meta come in. And what we're seeing at the batch level is just the models are
pretty abstracted out, right? On a day-to-day basis, like founders are already using different
models to prototype versus like build and scale. Like the ecosystem of model routers and
observability ops software around this stuff just keeps progressing really quickly. So just funny,
my initial reaction whenever I hear like the model releases is not to worry for the startups,
actually, so much. Because they're all like, we never talk about how reliant they are on any one
model. I worry if there's one model that's very, very good and it'll be dominant and sort of take
over the world. Uh, I'm less and less worried if there are many different alternatives because then
you have a market. And a marketplace equals, uh, you know, non-monopoly pricing. Which means that,
uh, you know, 1,000 flowers can actually bloom. Like other startups can actually make choices and
have gross margin of their own. And I'd much rather see, you know, thousands of companies make a
billion dollars a year each rather than, you know, one or two, let alone seven companies worth a
trillion dollars.

Diana Hu: And I think we have a dark horse that is yet TBD. We don't know when Llama 3 with 400
billion parameters comes out because that's still being trained. And that's like one that's like,
"Wow, it could really turn tables as well."

Jared Harge: Yeah, the interesting thing about Meta is I mean they have probably one of the largest
clusters, certainly...

Jared Friedman: I think I was reading, you know, in terms of who has paid Nvidia more money in the
past year, Meta apparently is number one by a decent bit actually. And the funny thing is they have
this giant cluster, not because they necessarily have foreseen this whole shift that happened
recently in the last couple of years with large language models. They acquired lots of GPUs because
they needed to train their recommendation models, right? That use actually similar architecture with
deep neural nets to actually compete with TikTok. Because to build these really good recommendations
on Instagram, that's just like very classic tech innovation and disruption, right? Like they're
basically worried about competing with TikTok, they bought a bunch of GPUs, and there turns out the
GPUs are just really valuable for this like completely different use case that's going to change the
world.

Host: Jared, like on that note, if you zoom out, just like how does this cycle of "hey, startups are
worried about the elephant in the room, in this case it's OpenAI, maybe Google competing and
crushing them"—how does it play out to when we first moved out here? Even like in that era where
Facebook was rising, Google was starting to go from the search engine company to like the multi-
product company. Do you see any similarities or differences?

Jared Friedman: Yeah, it reminds me of that a lot. Like, every time there's an OpenAI product
release now it feels like there's a bunch of startups waiting with bated breath to see whether
OpenAI is going to kill their startup. And then there's all this internet commentary afterwards
about like which startups got killed by the latest OpenAI release. And it reminds me a lot of when
we got to YC, the three of us in the like 2005 to 2010 era. There were all these companies who were
innovating in the same idea space as Google and Facebook, building like related products and
services where the big question was always like "what happens if Google does this?" And when
startups were pitching to investors, that was like the main big question that they'd always get from
investors: "Oh, but isn't Google gonna do this?" The best response to that, by the way, was like
"well, what if Google gets into VC?" Which it did. That's a great VC move. So a lot of the people
who are building AI apps now, this is the first hype cycle they've ever been in. But we've all been
through multiple hype cycles, and so I think it's interesting actually for the people who are in the
middle of this hype cycle now where all this is new to look back on the past hype cycles and see how
the history of what happened there can inform their decisions about what to work on.

If we take Google as an example, one thing that's interesting is: if you look back, there was
competing with Google in a very head-on way, which was "hey, we're going to build a better search
engine." And YC definitely funded a lot of companies trying that. And I feel like the approach
people would go after was the vertical engine. They'd say "we're going to build a better Google for
real estate," for example. Some of those made it. Did they?

Host: Well, you could, I mean, argue that something like Redfin or Zillow clearly did have vertical
access to data. And then, or Kayak for travel, I guess. Or Algolia for company enterprise search.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, that's true. Okay, those—yeah, I hadn't thought of Zillow as a search engine,
but yeah, it's essentially that. It's exactly that. It's vertical search. Yeah, but you have to
monetize, not necessarily through the same way a search engine would. You have to have other
services. You have to become a broker. You have to, you know, basically make money in all these
other ways. It's different. It doesn't look at all like Google.

Host: Yeah, and the data integrations are very different. Like you have to really poke and connect
to MLS. And a regular search engine wouldn't just work with that. Like Page Rank wouldn't
necessarily work with MLS.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, Redfin's very interesting because I'm very addicted to Redfin, and it has
actually absolutely caused me to buy property that I normally wouldn't buy. So, you know, in that
respect, like those are interesting consumer scenarios. Ultimately, a great consumer product is
actually about buying just like a little bit of someone's brain such that during the course of one's
day—I mean it doesn't have to be every day, but ideally it is—you sort of think to use it. And none
of those companies would have said that they had better technology or they beat Google on
technology, right? Like anyone who went head-to-head against Google for like the better general
purpose search engine just got crushed. And in general, most of the vertical search engines didn't
work. And certainly nothing that looks anything like Google worked.

The ones that I remember the most were more ones that were in the vein of Google apps. Like when
Google expanded beyond search and started launching Google Docs and Sheets and Slides and Maps and
Photos and all these separate apps, there were a lot of companies that we funded at YC that were
either going to be crushed or not by the next Google product.

Host: Yeah, that's like the Santa Casa. When you can bundle software in—I mean, this is what
Microsoft did to Netscape, right? Like once you can start bundling in software, especially in the
enterprise, it's like people don't necessarily want to buy like ten different solutions from ten
different vendors all the time. If you can offer a good enough product across several different use
cases and bundle them together, enterprises often want that. I mean, famously, Dropbox was in that
potentially rough position, right? Because Drew—and Drew actually talks about it when he comes back
and gives the dinner talks about the fear when Google Drive—and Google has his other product,
Carousel, right?

Jared Friedman: Yeah, in fact there is a time when Dropbox had launched. This was after the batch,
and Google was working on Google Drive but hadn't launched it. It was called G Drive. It was like
the secret project inside of Google. And news of it leaked to the press, and the whole world just
decided that Dropbox's goose was cooked. Like it was over. Google was going to launch G Drive, and
because it was Google, they had infinite money. They were going to do the same move that they're
doing now where they just throw like infinite money at the product and give away like infinite
storage for free. How could a startup possibly compete with Google spending billions of dollars to
give away infinite storage for free?

Host: That was infinite tokens. Yeah, and now it's infinite tokens. What are the big companies
trying to do right now that maybe you should avoid doing? And the super obvious one is: well, OpenAI
seems to have released GPT-4o, which is multimodal, and then it also simultaneously released the
first version of the desktop app. But that version of the desktop app is merely sort of a skin on
the web experience. But if you put two and two together, surely it's going to look a lot more like
"Her." I mean, they've been really shhh. Scarlett Johansson. They just pulled that, right?

Jared Friedman: Yeah, they're like "oh shoot," you know? Who knows? Are they getting sued? Who
knows? That's what Twitter says today anyway. But I think if you look at the details of that, you
know, you can sort of sketch out what's going to happen with LLMs on the desktop. And the desktop
sort of has access to all your files. It has access to not just that, but all of your applications.
It has access to your IDE locally. It has access to your browser. It can do transactions for you.
That's starting to look like basically the true personal assistant that is directly consumer. And
then that sounds like a whole category of like, you know, we're going to interface with computers
using potentially voice, and certainly we will have the expectation of a lot of smarts. And that,
you know, that seems like where they're going. And that's going to be one of the fights.

Host: When I was thinking back to like this first era of companies, I guess one thought I had is
that it was fairly predictable actually what Google would build. Not 100% predictable—like Dropbox,
it was unclear if Google would win that space. But like a lot of them are actually pretty obvious in
hindsight. Um, like adtech for example. Like all of adtech just like never stuck around because it
was like too strategic to Google and Facebook, and so they just had to own all of it. And like
almost all of vertical search just didn't really survive. It's pretty easy to imagine what the next
version of OpenAI product releases is going to be. And if you can easily imagine that what you're
building is going to be in the next OpenAI release, you know, maybe reconsider using that framework.
It's like OpenAI really wants to capture just like the imagination, like the sci-fi imagination of
everyone. So it's like yeah, like the general purpose AI system that you just talk to and it figures
out what you want and does everything. It seems hard to compete with them on that. That's like
competing with Google on search, right? That's clearly going to be like the core. Because that was
the early signs of why ChatGPT is being used for as well. Just like a very, very rudimentary...

Jared Friedman: Yeah, which is the same thing with Google. They always wanted to own products where
billions of people would all use the same product. Anything that was like that was going to be
really tough as a startup.

Host: Yeah, when I think of it for products I use, like Perplexity—not a company I own, but
Perplexity is a product I use a lot because it's much better for sort of research. If I need to fix
a toaster, it's way easier for me to type in like the model of the toaster into Perplexity and get
back like specific links and YouTube videos. Just the whole workflow. It was Diana who told me about
it, actually. I've been using it a lot as a replacement for my regular search.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, that's what I—I was trying to use Perplexity for a while and I couldn't get
it. And I was because I was trying to use it in the same way I would use like the OpenAI ChatGPT
app. And I was like "oh, but ChatGPT is just so much better" because I just like type in fuzzy
things and it figures it out and it comes back with smart things. And Perplexity just wasn't as good
for that use case. But the specific "hey, I have this task that I want like source material back and
links for it"—that works much, much, much better. It doesn't capture the imagination, right? Like
OpenAI is not going to like release a model where they demo like "oh look, if you search it, it
gives you the links back or it shows you the YouTube videos that it's referring to." The demo is not
as cool.

Host: Actually, Gemini 1.5 has that feature, and nobody really talks about it. The demos from Google
I/O are kind of like, so maybe one way to figure out how not to be roadkill is: if you can build the
valuable but unsexy thing that OpenAI aren't going to demo on stage because it doesn't capture the
sci-fi imagination, you might survive.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, that's definitely a whole line of thinking. Like Google was never going to do
Instacart or DoorDash's business or Uber. So all of that was fair game. And all of those turned out
to be, you know, decacorns or, you know, potentially, you know, even Airbnb—like hundred billion
dollar company.

The other thing people always underestimate is just I think the size of new markets. I remember for
a long time people didn't believe LinkedIn could be a big company because like "well, why?" Because
like Facebook won social networking. LinkedIn's just a social network. It's just going to be like a
work tab on your Facebook profile. Like why would you need something else? Same thing with Twitter.
I remember when I first moved to San Francisco in 2007, some of the first people I met were the
early Facebook employees. And they were like, they saw Twitter growing, and they're like "Ah yeah,
we're going to release status updates or something and just like Twitter's going to be done as just
a feature." But yeah, it turned out like Twitter was like a whole other thing.

Instacart and DoorDash, I think, is another great example of this. Again, I remember iPhone comes
out, Android becomes pervasive. It's like "oh, there it is. It's just going to be Apple and Google
dominate mobile." But there were all these things that they would never build. Same in this AI
world, probably, right? There's all these things that the big companies are never going to build.
And we probably have more appetite for using multiple AI agent type apps than just like the one
OpenAI one.

And a huge meta category that is basically almost anything that's B2B. Like Google basically never
built anything B2B. They like basically only built mass consumer software. And so if you look at the
YC unicorns, like a ton of them built, you know, some like B2B thing—like you Segment or something
that like Google was never going to build. Segment—that's just like not interesting to them.

Host: I want to because I think in B2B, people really underestimate the human part of it. Like so
much of it is actually the sales machine and it's being willing to go out and figure out who you
sell to, do the sales, like listen to someone, like give you all the things they're unhappy about
and note them down and take them back to your engineering team and say "oh yeah, we need to tweak
this, this, and this, and all these details," right? Like and build lots of really detailed software
to like handle all these obscure edge cases.

Like I think of one of our AI companies at YC that's doing really well is called Permit Flow, and
they literally just expedite the process for applying for construction permits. And not just for
individuals, but for like big construction companies now as well. It's like, yeah, like really hard
to imagine that being the next OpenAI release, right? Like "hey guys, we built a feature for filing
your construction permits." Like, can you...

Jared Friedman: Yeah, can you imagine turning up for your first day of work as an OpenAI engineer
and they're like "okay, you're going to work on the construction permit workflow feature?" They
think it works that way. Well, I guess if you join those two ideas together, something interesting
happens though. It seems sort of inevitable sometime in the next two to five years. You know,
assuming the OpenAI "Her" digital assistant comes out and then it's going to be on your desktop. It
will actually know everything about you. It'll know what you're doing. It'll know minute to minute
what task you're trying to complete. And then it's conceivable that if you mash that with sort of a
launch that I think they probably didn't invest enough into, which was like the GPT Store, you could
sort of imagine that might extend into B2B as well. And then they would sort of charge that vig. But
I think the thing that I don't think is going to work for B2B actually is I think there's a lot of
sensitivity around the workflows and the data because they're highly proprietary, especially in
spaces with fintech and healthcare. I mean, for good reasons they should be very regulated and have
a lot of privacy data to protect the consumers. So I think the other area that we've been having
also success for AI B2B applications has been in fintech. We found that Greenlight, that's doing KYC
using AI to replace all the humans that do a lot of the validation of consumer identities. Or we
also have Greenboard, right?

Host: Right, they both start with green.

Jared Friedman: Greenboard that was also doing a lot of the compliance things for banks as well.

Host: Yeah, Bronco is doing it in AR, and there are a bunch of more companies doing things in
payments and just any of the boring day-to-day that you know, someone—I mean is sort of wrote doing
it. Um, this can just basically supercharge that and you know, have one person do the work of ten.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, we call this...

Jared Friedman: I think that is literally true for B2B companies where it's like the underlying
models. Like B2B software business models are so much about how do I upsell? Like, how do I make
more money per customer next year than I did this year? And it just, hey, like every time the model
gets better, you can just pass that along as like an upsell, premium feature or an upgrade to the
software. And your end user doesn't care, right? Like they just care about what the function the
software can do for them. And so I think there's a world where the models keep getting better.
You've got your choice of which one to use, and the additional functionality you just charge your
customers for and you make more money.

Host: Yeah, that's definitely what we're seeing at YC. I mean, last batch, people were making $6
million a year right at the beginning of the batch and it ended up being north of 30 million by the
end of the batch. So that's some really outrageous revenue growth in a very, very short amount of
time, three or four months. And that's sort of on the back of, uh, you know, a few people working on
B2B software. You know, they can focus on a particular one that makes a lot of money, and then
people are willing to fork out a lot of cash if they see ROI pretty much immediately.

Host: There's not as many founders working in this area as there should be given the size of the
opportunity. Like, like to your point, Harj, like people often underestimate how big these markets
are. Like using LLM to automate various jobs is probably as large an opportunity as SaaS, like all
the SaaS combined, right? Because like SaaS is basically the tools for the workers to do the jobs.
The AI equivalent of SaaS is like it just does the jobs, tool plus the people. Yeah, so like it
should be just as large. And yeah, there should be like a lot more people working on this.

Host: So there might be, you know, billions to trillions of dollars per year going into
transactional labor revenue that's on someone's, uh, you know, sort of, you know, cash flow
statement right now, but it'll turn into software revenue at 10x, which will be interesting for
market caps over the next 10, 20 years.

Host: I was doing office hours with a startup this morning that asked me this question about, hey,
like you probably saw the GPT-4 launch, like should we be worried about it? Um, yeah, my reply was
you should be worried about it, but you should be worried about the other startups that are like
competing with you. Because ultimately, it's all of the stuff we're talking about. It's whoever
builds the best product on top of these models with all the right nuances and details is going to
win. And that's going to be one of the other startups in the space. So I just think the meta thing
as a startup now is you have to be on top of these announcements and be kind of know what you're
going to build in anticipation of them before someone else does versus being worried about OpenAI or
Google being the ones to build them.

Host: Let's talk a little bit about consumer because we did talk about what could be potentially
real for consumer startups. If you're going against basically an assistant, some sort of assistant
type of thing, OpenAI is hinting, well, strongly directing, and they're going in that direction.
What about opportunities for consumer AI companies? What are those things that they could flourish?

Host: Well, here's an edgy one. Anything that involves legal or PR risk is challenging for
incumbents to take on. Microsoft giving money to OpenAI in the first place, you could argue, was
really about that. I mean, when image models, image diffusion models first came out at Google, they
were not allowed to generate the human form for PR and legal risk reasons. This is a large part of
what created the opportunity for OpenAI in the first place, as Google was too scared to jeopardize
their golden goose by releasing this technology to the public. The same thing could probably be true
now for startups. Things that are increasingly edgy are often the places where there's great startup
opportunities.

Host: I mean, things like, uh, Replica AI, which was an AI NLP company working in this space for
many years even before LLMs were a thing, still one of the top companies doing the AI boyfriend or
girlfriend. And the wild thing about Replica is that they've been in touch with their sort of AI
boyfriend or girlfriend for many years. And earlier we were talking about, you know, a million token
context window. You can imagine that virtual entity knowing everything about you like for many, many
years, like even your, you know, deepest, darkest secrets and desires. I mean, that's pretty wild
stuff. But um, you, it's going to look weird. Like, that and, um, you know, people might not be
paying attention. I mean, Character AI has really, really deep retention, and people are sort of
spending hours per day sort of using things like that. So, you know, whatever happens in consumer,
it might be non-obvious and it might be very weird like that.

Host: So there's a lot of kind of more edgy stuff around deep fakes that are applied in different
spaces. So there's a company that you work with, Jared. Infinity AI, right?

Host: Yeah, Infinity AI lets you turn any script into a movie, and that movie can involve famous
characters. And so like, enables you to make famous people say whatever is in your mind, which is
edgy, which is part of what makes it like interesting and cool. Google would never launch that.
Would never launch that. And I think even, you know, the same move that OpenAI did to Google, which
is being willing to release something that's really edgy, well, OpenAI is now the incumbent. Guys,
they now can't release super edgy stuff like that anymore.

Host: We're going to see a lot of that during election season in particular, right? Because it's
interesting when you think about it. Like, anything that's on the, hey, like it's explicitly like a
famous person, this is explicitly using the likeness of a famous person for a profit, is going to
get shut down. On the other hand, you have like, if I make a meme with Will Smith and some like a
caption, like no one's going to sue me for that. And a lot of this content is like right in the
middle, right? It's like I'm not trying to build like a video that's literally, I want people to
believe that it's like these people saying these things. But what if it's like a joke about a joke
or a satire, like where does that fit? And yeah, you can't see, you can't imagine Facebook or
Instagram is going to roll this out on Instagram anytime soon, right? Like they want to stay well
clear of that. But you're already seeing this version of memes, sort of 2.0, that are basically deep
fixed, that are making the rounds and they're becoming viral tweets, right?

Host: Yeah, hey, why don't we clear out by going to a question that one of our audience asked us on
Twitter. Um, so thank you, Sandip, for this question. Question is: What specific update from OpenAI,
Google, Meta excited each of you and why? I'll give one. Um, the thing that really excited me about
the OpenAI release was the emotion in the generated voice. And I didn't realize how much I was
missing this from the existing text-to-speech models until I heard the OpenAI voice.

Host: Oh, a bedtime story about robots and love. I got you covered. Once upon a time in a world not
too different from ours, there was a robot named Byte.

Host: It's amazingly better compared to the incumbent text-to-speech model because it actually knows
what it's saying. The existing ones by contrast sound so robotic. They're like, they're totally
understandable, but they're just very boring to listen to. And the OpenAI one, it felt like you were
talking to a human.

Host: My one was the translator, um, demo. The idea of basically having a live translator in your
pocket. It's personal for me because my wife is Brazilian, her parents don't speak English, and so
I've been learning Portuguese, but it's coming along very slowly. The like, the idea of having just
like a translator that's always in my pocket that makes it easy for me to communicate with anyone
anywhere in the world is really exciting.

Host: Hey, how's it been going? Have you been up to anything interesting recently?

Host: It's a massive idea. I mean, it could change the world. You could go live in a foreign country
where you don't speak the language. It like, it is huge consequences.

Host: Yeah, Douglas Adams, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, uh, made real is a pretty cool one. I
guess for me, um, what's funny about GPT-4 is it sounds like maybe it was actually just a reorg.
Basically there was a reorganization at OpenAI and they realized they want all of the teams rowing
in the same direction. And then what that means is probably really good things for both their
assistant desktop product, uh, but also eventually robotics, which, um, might be a really big deal
down the road. This Chinese company called Unitree announced a $116,000 human biped robot. Though
Twitter warns me that it's another $50,000 if you actually want open API access. Previously they
made a $114,000 version of that robot. Um, but I think unified models means more and more likelihood
that practical robotics is, you know, actually not that far away. Famous last words, of course.
We've been saying that pretty consistently for many years in a row, but this time it's different.

Host: I think for me, maybe a bit more of a technical one. I know it doesn't sound too too fancy,
but really the half the cost is like a huge thing. And if you extrapolate that, what that means is
probably a lot of these models are hitting some kind of asymptotic growth of how much better they
can get, which means also that they're becoming more stable. And it can open up the space for actual
custom silicon to process all of these and enable a lot more low power processing to enable robotics
and build the device that you mentioned and actually have it in your packet and not be tied to the
Internet. So all these things that we could perhaps see excitement of new tech product releases,
because I kind of missed those days when every product tech demo was like very exciting. Now it's
just like kind of like a feature.

Host: True, we could be excited about new things coming up. Well, we're going to be really excited
to see what you guys all come up with. That's it for this week. We'll see you next time.
