## Transcript

Speaker: I think we thought the product was going to be one way and then we literally ripped it all
up in a month and a half or so before release. We were sort of like lost in the jungle for a
moment—like a bit of a panic. There's a lot of unsolved problems. Basically, I mean, you—even this
version of it, you know, people are going to try it and then they might be blown away by it, but
like the next one's going to be even crazier. To get to Soda, you basically have to be maniacal
about like every detail there. There's going to be some people that train their models and they get
cool text generation, but the kerning is off. Are you the kind of person that will care about the
kerning being off? Or are you the kind of person that is okay with it? Like, or you don't even
notice it?

Gary Tan: Welcome back to another episode of the Lightcone. I'm Gary. This is Jared, Harj, and
Diana, and collectively we have funded companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars—usually just
with one or two people just starting out. And we're in the middle of this crazy AI Revolution, and
so we thought we would invite our friend Sohel Doshi, founder and CEO of Playground, which is the
state-of-the-art image generation model with also a state-of-the-art user experience. And it just
launched. So how you feeling?

Sohel Doshi: Very under pressure right now.

Gary Tan: That's good. You sound like a startup founder. So which is normal. Maybe the best way to
start off is to look at some examples of the images that you were able to generate. Um, and this is
stuff sort of right off the presses. So at Y Combinator, I also am one of the group partners, so I
fund a number of companies every batch. I funded about 15 for the summer batch. And so what we're
looking at here is one of the t-shirt designs I made. As you can see, there's a GPU, and it was
based on one of the core templates in your library. I like metal, so this very much spoke to me.
This one was off of a sticker design, and I guess I just really like that sword. And what I was able
to do is add GPU fans.

Jared Friedman: Love it. Love it.

Gary Tan: And so that's one of the noteworthy things about Playground. You can upload an image;
it'll sort of extract the essence of, like, sort of the aesthetic and some of the features of it.

Diana Hu: This feels like—feels like a tattoo.

Gary Tan: Yeah, exactly. Do you remember what you prompted it with to get those?

Sohel Doshi: Oh yeah. I basically—so the cool thing about Playground—to create this, I picked a
default template that I liked. Um, and I think it only had the sword and sort of this ribbon. And I
said, "Make it say House Tan on the ribbon," and um, "Add a GPU with two fans." I was very specific.
I wanted a two-fan GPU. And that's one of the things you'll see in all these designs.

Gary Tan: This is actually the t-shirt that House Tan itself actually chose. So, um, you know, it's
a very summery vibe. I think this was based on something around summer and surfing, and we replaced
the surfboard with a GPU.

Sohel Doshi: I feel like you used a preset that we had.

Gary Tan: I did all these from presets. They're pretty good. I think the noteworthy thing that I was
able to do is, um, I didn't have to like prompt and reprompt and reprompt and sort of keep trying to
refine the same text prompt. Like, I actually could just talk to a designer, and it would just give
me what I wanted. Going from left to right, for instance, by default, I think the template had this
yellowish background, and I said, "Make it on white." And so that was like a very unusual
interaction that I, you know, I'm not used to. Like, usually you're used to either Discord with
Midjourney, or you're sort of used to a chat interface or like prompt and then twiddle things and
reprompt and reprompt and reprompt. Whereas this felt much more natural language. I could just talk
to, uh, you know, a machine designer that would, uh, take my feedback into account.

Jared Friedman: Yeah, normally when you make these kinds of images, you have to like describe all of
it, right? You'd have to say like, "I want it on this, you know, beige background and I want this
orange sunset," and then you'd have to even just describe like the lines of the sun. And you know,
or you don't describe very much, and then every time you try, it's like totally different from the
other thing. So usually, you know, you either have to learn like a magical incantation of words, or,
uh, versus being able to like pick something that you start from. And then also with these images,
Gary, did you add this text in post-processing, or is the model actually like incorporating the text
organically?

Sohel Doshi: Oh, the model will both—your direction on what should be there, what its size is. It
can—you can actually specify where in the design. You could say, "I want it in the middle. I want it
at the top." Could we use a font that's bigger, smaller, you know, uh, better lettering? Could
you—could you crop it a little bit? Like, you could just speak to it in plain English, and I've
never seen that in any image model today.

Diana Hu: That's crazy because the text is flawless. And anyone who's used DALL-E knows that if you
try to get it to write text, the text comes out like garbled. And like, yeah, it's pretty incredible
having just accurate text and then being able to position the text exactly where you want. That is
very cool.

Harj Taggar: It is really, Sohel, in terms of text adherence and coherence, in terms of following
prompts, which is really cool. One thing that we think is really cool is it's inventing fonts. Like,
I don't know what font that is.

Sohel Doshi: Yeah, it might be a real font, but I think that, um, but there are all these
circumstances where it's actually just—it's like extrapolating from many different kinds of fonts
and like actually inventing new things, um, which is really, really cool.

Gary Tan: Okay, and these are just a couple of other versions. You know, I saw some old-timey thing,
and I was like, "Okay, could you do a vectory version of a GPU?" On the left, and then on the right,
you know, there was a very sort of Japanese art house aesthetic.

Sohel Doshi: These are great.

Gary Tan: And this one, I, if left to my own devices, I was going to print this one because I really
like it.

Sohel Doshi: Yeah.

Gary Tan: And what I could do is actually tell it, like, "Make it even—even more, uh, sort of
prototypically like Japanese art, you know? Like, I want more waves and like more sun." And you
know, it basically kept doing it. I think I know this preset. I remember making this preset like a
month and a half ago. I think it's called like "Mythic Inc" or something. That's how the app works,
you know? You open the app, you select a preset, or you can upload your own design that you're like
really into, and then it will seemingly extract the vibe of that particular thing. Like, you know,
it won't—it's not going to be a copy. It will be a remix.

Diana Hu: Did you purposefully design it to be so good with text, or is that like an emergent
property of just how you architected everything?

Sohel Doshi: We definitely focused on making text accuracy really good. I think it's been kind of
our number one focus. And part of it is that text to us is so interrelated with actually the utility
of graphics and design, um, because a lot of things without text just mostly feel like art. But
yeah, text was an extraordinary high priority, and it was really hard, actually. There's like
a—maybe a point there where like our text accuracy was 45%. We were sort of like lost in the jungle
for a moment, like a bit of a panic. But we figured it out. I think one of the remarkable things on
all these designs is that a lot of—uh, I was playing a lot with it as well. A lot of the outputs are
very utilitarian and useful because they play with Midjourney and all of those. And I think they're
fun, but they're more like toys, more like art. But it's really hard to work with it if you actually
wanted to design logos, t-shirts, font sizes. I could totally see this replacing Adobe Illustrator,
right?

Jared Friedman: Right, yeah.

Sohel Doshi: I think that, you know, part of it's kind of funny. It's like the reason why we're—I'm
partly so excited about graphic design is because actually when I was younger, when I was in high
school, I used to do logo contests. And I would try to win them. I think there's a site called like
SitePoint.net or something. And, um, and I was just trying to make like a little bit of money before
college—before going to college. And uh, and so I did all these like logo designs and did all these
tutorials, um, trying to win them. And and so during the training of this model, I tested it for
logos, and I started to be like, "Wow, it's actually way better than anything I could have made."
And then I've also made like my own company logos typically, which are also very bad. And so it just
feels to me like if you can get text and you can get these other kinds of use cases, um, you're
probably going to be able to beat the—like, at least the midpoint designer, um, graphic designer,
that's an Illustrator. And then I think over time we should be able to get to like the 90th
percentile designer, graphic designer. So this is actually a really different use case that really
hasn't been addressed. You know, I haven't seen image models try to design graphics or
illustrations. It's less, uh, you know, generating really cool images that would replace stock art
or something like that. Uh, it's more literally allowing you to create Canva-type things, right, you
know, whenever you want, and you don't have to mess around with it. It's, you know, plain
English—just talk to the model. The model is going to create what you want.

Harj Taggar: I've never seen anything like that.

Sohel Doshi: Yeah, I think we we're just sort of like looking at what are the use cases for graphic
design. And it's, you know, when it—actually interestingly, it has a lot of real-world, like,
physical impact, physical world impact, because there are like bumper stickers and then t-shirts. I
think it was at Outside Lands the other weekend, and I was just looking at everyone's t-shirts,
looking at what they have on them. And I I saw a bunch of women at Outside Lands had this thing—this
t-shirt that said, uh, "I feel like 2007 Britney." I just thought that was such a cool shirt. And so
we made the template for it and put it in the product. And but there's just like so much cool real-
world impact. And there's, and I think that the world often sometimes thinks that—um, I'm almost—I'm
almost a little disappointed that MySpace doesn't exist. For those that were on MySpace, because it
was such an expressive social network, and I feel like humans really deeply care about that form of
expression. And um, and so it's really cool to be able to make a model that's like really focused on
all those kinds of things. But you're actually building a product. It's not just research because
when—yeah, with all these designs in Playground, you can actually go and purchase them. Like the,
yeah, stickers, the t-shirt, right?

Jared Friedman: Right, can you tell us about kind of this marketplace that you're building?

Sohel Doshi: Yeah, so I think that, you know, one thing we we learned was that it's kind of hard for
people to prompt. And because it's hard to prompt, it's hard—we found also it's hard to teach people
how to prompt. Like, and the truth is that when you make these models, it's not like we even know
how it works. We are also discovering with the community how the model kind of works. And so one of
the things that we decided to do, uh, was, uh, you know, me and and our designer—we decided that one
core belief was that the product should be visual first, not text first, which is a huge departure
from like language models and ChatGPT, because, uh, because our product is so visual—why should it
not be? And so in order to make it visual first and to make it so that you don't have to learn how
to prompt, uh, we decided that we would start from something like a template, which is something
people already understand in a tool like Canva, right? It's not something that we necessarily
invented. Like, there's templates everywhere. But I think that if you could start from a template
and then we could make it really easy to modify that template, then it feels like we've already
taken you like 80 percent of the journey. If it was like, "I feel like 2007 Britney," but then you
wanted to change the celebrity in the year to a different person, then you totally could. Wanted to
make that very easy. Um, but it also required a lot of integration with research, because how do you
make these changes? How do you make them coherent? How do you keep things, like, similar? It's not
as simple as, you know, just 75–77 tokens that you put into Stable Diffusion. The existing open-
source models aren't really capable of that. So it required kind of, yeah, like the marrying of like
what a good product should feel like and what and and then, you know, enabling that with research,
which is not always possible.

Harj Taggar: I think that's what Gary was getting at with you building the state-of-the-art UX, the
UI for all these models. Because up to this point, people just get raw access. It feels like kind of
back in the days you would just SSH to a computer and kind of work with it. That's how people
interact with these models. But you kind of basically built a whole new browser into it. Nobody has
done it, and you've done it really well. Can you talk about this idea of uh, departing from raw
model access?

Sohel Doshi: Yeah, I think—I think just we observed the users over 18 months, like, failing, you
know? And and so it's—it's AI is a little bit weird right now because there's—there's so
much—there's such a big novelty factor. I would say, and it's exciting because we're able to do
things we've never been able to do before. And so as a result, you get—you can easily get millions
of users using your product. And that's totally what happened to us. And so it feels almost like,
"Oh, maybe I've got the product." But then when you actually go look at the data and how people are
using it, there's just—there's this—there's this constant failure—people using the product. And so
yeah, you're talking about sort of uh, the prior version of Playground.

Harj Taggar: The prior version of Playground, yeah.

Sohel Doshi: So it didn't have this type of model. It didn't—um, it was—we—most, yeah, we used like
open-source models. And then we started training some of our own that are very similar to Stable
Diffusion as like a way to ramp up to where we are now. When we watched users prompt this model—that
you know, obviously the two pieces of feedback were, um, you know, "This is fun. It's cool. Uh, I
can get like a cat drinking beer," and then you post it to Twitter and it's exciting. Yeah, but
then—but why would people come back, you know? Is one big question. And then the second part is that
people are using our service a lot, but they're not always using our service a lot because it's like
a useful thing. It's because they're—they're not getting what they want, so they have to keep
retrying.

Harj Taggar: Yeah, yeah, you know, where like Google's trying to get you off the website, you know,
that sort of feeling? Like, it's almost bad that people are using it too much in some in some sense.

Sohel Doshi: And, um, you know, they just keep re—we call it "rerolling," right? Just keep rerolling
to get a different image or slightly better image to fix like a paw or tail that's off, you know?
And the other thing that happened was that our model can take an extremely long prompt. Like, most
of these models, you can only write 75 tokens. But with our model, it's like 8,000. And most people,
you're never really going to go over a thousand right now—I say that now, but we'll see. Thousand
tokens is a lot, um, and and our model lets you be extremely descriptive. And so you can you can
really describe the texture of the—

Sohel Doshi: Table skin texture, we have all those like puzzle prompts where it's like green
triangle next to an orange cube, you know, and it works. Like, spatial reasoning is all there.
Actually, including text that's totally novel and really I'd never seen that before. You know, the
first generation of these models, almost immediately what you do is say like, "Generate me a
green... you know, green sphere on top of a blue, uh, you know, triangle," right? And it just
wouldn't do it. It's like, you know, there would be those elements but it would just be all jumbled
up because it was using CLIP. It did not have contextual reasoning or understanding.

Host: Yeah, and CLIP, CLIP was trained with a lot of error actually because it's just using kind of
the alt tags of the images that are scraped on the internet, which could be like anything.

Sohel Doshi: We sort of decided that what we were going to spend our time on was prompt
understanding and text generation accuracy because we also felt like aesthetics were kind of
saturating. Like, they're getting better, but they're also just kind of not getting better at a fast
enough rate. And users, even vote and say, even in the Midjourney Discord, you know, they'll poll
their users and they'll say, "What do you want to be better?" And like, aesthetics is like going
lower and lower on the rank of things that people care about. So we wanted to leap on something that
really mattered to users, which was prompt understanding and text generation accuracy for those
kinds of use cases.

And, uh, but when you have a very long prompt, it's not really feasible to ask anybody like, are you
going to write like an essay? And so we started to realize that actually the prompt is... it's
almost like it's kind of like HTML for graphics, which I think is so cool.

Host: I think you've done a lot here because you completely have a novel architecture that really
gets to magical prompting. Because the experience of using Playground is feel as if you're talking
to a designer. It has a coherence. It listens to you. Because with other... I know with Midjourney,
if you want to move the text or that, it doesn't, and the positional awareness is not there. I guess
one of the insights you had when we chatted a bit earlier: one of the problems you learned to create
good designs, you have to have a lot of description for the images.

Sohel Doshi: Yeah, and users are basically lazy, right?

Host: Right. They might just tell you, "I want a nature scene." And if you input this into
Midjourney, what would it give you?

Sohel Doshi: Yeah, it'll give you like this very beautiful, very rich, high contrast nature scene.
But you've done something very interesting. We want to talk a bit about how you've done kind of
aiding users and expanding upon the prompt to actually build something much better.

The first thing to kind of improve our prompt understanding was just like making your data better,
pretty much. It's actually just that simple. And so one of the first things we wanted to do was we
wanted to have extremely detailed prompts. So when we train the model, we train on very detailed
prompts. But we also want users to feel like they could just say "nature scene." And so sort of what
you see here is just how detailed we can get. And actually, we're even more detailed than this these
days. When we train the next model, it'll be even more than this.

But once you get to like this level of detail, I mean, we're just teaching the model to represent
all of these concepts correctly, you know? Whether something is in the center or whether there's
like a background blur. One thing that we want to get better at, and I think we're actually already
pretty good at this, is emotional expression. He's like... another thing. Like, we have this image
of Elon Musk and he's like disgusted, he's anxious, he's happy, he's sad, he's confident. And like,
trying to see his expression in all these different ways. And so that's just one thing that we want
to make sure is represented in these prompts.

There's obviously a lot more, like, you know, spatial location. And so by doing this, we can ensure
that the model can be a good experience if you raw prompted it as a user. If you just said nothing.
And most of the time, users are not really writing more than like maybe caption three here or
something like that. I mean, even that's kind of a lot.

Host: That's a lot, I think. When I was playing, I was mostly like on five and six.

Sohel Doshi: Yeah, yeah, exactly. When you're playing around, the normies are kind of doing five and
six, and then the like hardcore prompters are like copying each other's prompts. And then they end
up more like one. But they don't even look like one, and one is a very natural way of typing, you
know? Like, nobody's writing these like essays and paragraphs of text. It's too much work. And that
was one thing that we knew we were going to probably fail if we expected users to do this.

So this kind of led us to a more visual approach where you're like picking something you already
like in the world that we understand how that's represented in our model, and then we can like make
those changes and edits and stuff like that.

Host: Is the benefit of like expanding the prompts this way that you're more likely to get what the
user wants at the first go, or is it that it just makes it easier for them to iterate on it to get
to what they want?

Sohel Doshi: You know, I don't even know that we necessarily needed to do this, but I think the
reason why we did it was because initially we didn't know how good the model would be. And so we
needed to serve users in the way that they already use the existing models. And so we didn't exactly
know the breakthrough interface. We hadn't gotten there yet. And so in order to make sure that we
would work the way everyone is happy with, we wanted to do this kind of like segmented out. It's
almost like lossy prompt. And so that's why we do it. But I think, you know, it's not even that it's
not as necessary, but I think the other reason to do it this way is once the prompts get extremely
detailed, it's hard to have too much variation between the images because you're kind of locking in
on your image.

Host: Yep.

Sohel Doshi: And so by having kind of ambiguity in the prompt, you can get more variational ability.
So there's like, we call it image diversity. So that way you say "squash dish," but it's like really
different each time.

Host: Yeah. I guess the cool thing about your product is you basically remove all of the prompt
engineering with zero guess because you do it behind the scenes with expanding and exploding into
this multi-caption level system, right? I guess what comes to mind is sort of back in the day, if
you needed to navigate a website through the command terminal, maybe curl and do GET or POST,
literally like typing the commands until you had like a browser to actually have the right UI,
right?

What I told my team was, I said, "Yeah, we should be doing the prompt engineering for users. It
should not be like the users are the prompt engineers." And then they like... or the prompt graphic
designers, if you will. Here. But like, it shouldn't be like the users have to go like, "What are we
going to do, write a manual on how to do this?" You know, it's just too tricky. Like, 1% of humanity
will understand that manual, and the rest will be like, "I don't know how to use this. Too
difficult." So I think it's really valuable that, you know, I told my team I think it's very
important we do all of that work. Like, we should have an extremely strong sense of how the model
works rather than putting that on the users.

Where I think it's... and then the other thing that we do is we now work with creators to help us
like kind of construct these different templates and different prompts around these templates and
stuff like that. And they might be like the 1% of humanity that's willing to learn this on behalf of
users. And this is totally normal. That's what, that's what YC does. We know we like build these
great companies that, you know, every like billions of people in humanity use as a result of that.

Host: Yeah. I guess there's two things out of this that come out. One is you might be creating this
whole new set of a profession. Sort of back in the day with design, you have beans, where people
hire designers. Right now, people will through Playground hire like AI designers that are this
right? Top person?

Sohel Doshi: Well, we're doing it actually. So we are hiring them.

Host: Oh, you're hiring them?

Sohel Doshi: Yes. We're hiring them. We're going to launch a Creator program soon actually, and the
goal is to bring on creators that have good taste. That still matters, right? Like, you know,
there's this image of a squash dish, but it's not like a very beautiful image. And there is... I
think taste is still real in the world. And it's also in design, you know? In LLMs, you get to
measure how well you did on a biology test, and that's like a pretty objective thing. But for
design, it's constantly evolving. Like, design from ten years ago can look dated unless you're
like... Dior, Rom. But I think, you know, more fundamentally, we want to bring on creators that are
going to help create graphics that other people can then use. And we're actually paying them.

Host: I guess one thing that's cool. The second thing: because of this, you actually are state-of-
the-art on many aspects for this model. So much of it was driven by product. Because now, in order
to get the good captioning, you probably are beating GPT-4, right, in terms of image?

Sohel Doshi: We are beating, yeah. We now have a new... like, SODA captioner, yeah? To generate
these. And that was not just to be like a benchmark, but actually a very practical purpose to build
the model.

Host: Yeah. Can you maybe tell us a bit of what's underneath? Because PG V3, Playground V3, right,
is all novel and state-of-the-art on many aspects?

Sohel Doshi: Yeah. So the whole architecture of the model, we had to like rip everything out. Um, so
like the normal Stable Diffusion architecture that people know about is like there's a Variational
Autoencoder, a VAE, and then there's CLIP, and then there's like this UNet architecture. For people
that are in the know. And then since then it's kind of evolved to using, you know, more
Transformers. Like, there's this great paper by, I think it was like William Peebles, um, that did
DiT, which I think is like what people believe Sora is based on as well. And then so there's some
new models that are using that.

Um, we actually don't use any of those new architectures either. We did something completely from
scratch. But one of the reasons why we had to kind of blow everything up was because you can't
really get this kind of prompt understanding using CLIP. Because there's just so much air in CLIP,
and it's also like just bounded by just the architecture of that model.

And then the second thing is we also... we also needed the text accuracy to be really high. So you
can't just like use the off-the-shelf VAE from Stable Diffusion because it cannot reconstruct small
details. Like, I don't know if you guys ever noticed, but the hands and the logos, hands zoomed out,
faces? Yeah. You need something... you also need like a state-of-the-art VAE or something like a VAE
that's better than the existing one. Like, the existing one's like four-channel. Um, and so there's
all these pieces, and they all interact, and they can all bound the overall performance of your
model. And so we basically looked at every single piece. And then, I think, like four months ago,
there was... I think with the team, there was literally we were at the whiteboard with the research
team, and there was like the non-risky architecture, which was kind of more similar to some of the
open, the state-of-the-art open-source models that are out these days, like Flux and stuff. And then
there was like this other architecture that shall not be named. Um, and we were like, "Well, that's
that, that's like the risky one, where we don't even know if it'll work. And if we try it for two or
three months, we'll like waste compute. And if it didn't, it might just like blow up. And then we'll
be behind." And we just like put everything in that basket.

Host: Nice.

Sohel Doshi: We decided that, um, we had no choice, you know? It was like we were just going to fail
if we didn't do it anyway.

Host: I think what's remarkable is you are order of magnitude on text and in a lot of all these
aspects, you're basically SOTA. I think that's really impressive. Can we maybe talk a bit about as
much as you can, how you beat the text and code? I mean, you tease that out a bit. You basically
don't use CLIP because the traditional Stable Diffusion just uses the last layer, right? But you
guys have done something completely new where you allowed basically almost infinite context window
because Midjourney is only 256. The prompt adherence, like, you can actually talk to it like a
designer. So tell us, what can you talk about that?

Sohel Doshi: Yeah, um, that as much as you can tell us about? I think it's fair, fair to ask the
question. Share as much as you want. I think that to kind of get here, you know, there's some
obvious things that you would do. The most obvious thing that you would do, you know, is not use
CLIP. But the second most obvious thing is kind of like using the tailwinds of what's already
happening in language, you know? Like, the language models already so deeply understand everything
about text. And so there's some models that use this, you know? They use like T5 XXL, which has
this... it's like another embedding, but it's like a much more rich embedding of language
understanding. Kind of feel like language is just the first. It's just the first thing that
happened. And there's a whole bunch of AI companies that are going to come about, whether they train
their models or not, that are just going to benefit from everything that's going on in language and
in open-source language. And so, you know, I think our model is able to have such great prompt
understanding in part because of the big boom in language and all of the stuff that, whether it's
Google or Meta or what have you, is doing.

And so we're just... we can be slightly behind in terms of language for our prompt understanding
because the language stuff is already just so good, and it will just continue to get better. And our
models will also continue to get better. So that might be my like one small hint.

Maybe the analogy playing with a lot of this, and from chatting with you, the current state-of-the-
art Stable Diffusion models' language understanding feels like in the NLP land, like Word2Vec,
right? Word2Vec was this paper that came out from Google in 2013, and it didn't really understand
text per se. It was more at the latent space. The famous example was that it could take the vector
of "King" and then you would subtract the vector of "Man" and then add the vector of "Woman," and
the output would be the vector of "Queen," right, which is like, but very basic and still very cool.
Which I think is what Stable Diffusion, current current models before you are. But playing with your
model, you basically... the leap to, for the audience, the leap is that you basically got GPT-level
of understanding is like, sort of the Word2Vec to GPT was I don't know, like six, ten years?

Sohel Doshi: Yeah, I'd say it's like GPT-3 level image model. Like, sort of prompt understanding
now, yeah.

Host: And I think there's much more leap. There's another leap to go. Many more actually, I would
say.

Sohel Doshi: And that's impressive. It's safe to say that this is the worst the model has, will ever
be. For sure.

Host: Yeah. For sure. I mean, there's, you know, small things that we already want to fix.

Host: Like, you know, we wish that the model understood concepts like film grain. I mean, it could
still go, still be better at spatial positioning. Um, even like, the model has issues with like the
idea of like left and right. Like, "put the bear to the left." What is left? Is it to, you know, is
it your left? Is it the bear's left? So there's still like lots of interesting problems that I think
are really fun, uh, to probably we're going to have to figure out. But what we hear from users is
that they feel a strong sense of control now. Like, it has really good prompt adherence.

And actually, there was this really funny thing when you, uh, you know, I think like a week or two
ago that we realized about the model, which is when we started to do eval for aesthetics. You know,
and the way we do this is we just show like two—it's an AB test. We show users two images, one from
maybe a rival of ours, and then another image from our model. And we're constantly doing evals and
constantly asking our users what they think so that we can get better.

And anyway, one of the things that we realized was that there's this new thing that I don't think
has been talked about. But you, apologize to the audience if, if there if this has been talked
about, but there's a problem with, uh, we have entanglement issues, which is that if the, um, if the
model adheres too well to the prompt, it can adjust. It can like, it can have an effect on
aesthetics. So when we compare ourselves to say something like Midjourney, which you, we've actually
eval it, has great aesthetics—best in the world at that. One of the problems is is that we will get
dinged because our model is adhering more.

So I'll give you an example. We have an image and it's like a image of a woman and it's like kind of
like a split plane. Like she's on this side and on this side. So it's like a two, it's like a
composite. And Midjourney doesn't respect that. It just shows the woman one frame. The users will
always pick that because it's more aesthetically pleasing compositionally versus this like split
plane thing. But our model is adhering to that prompt. Right?

Right. And so the users ding us and then we get a lower aesthetic score to me because it's not
listening. And so there's this entanglement problem. Like, what do you do? We had another image that
was, uh, like hand painted palm trees or something, and the users chose the other model because they
were less hand painted looking. And the hand painted ones do look less aesthetic, but our model is
adhering. So we have this entanglement problem, and we don't know how to measure ourselves for
aesthetics now. And there's no—I not aware of any. If anyone has any literature, please send it to
me—but I'm not aware of any literature on this. And so we don't know what to do.

I think what it sounds to me is basically your model is too good, so the current evals don't work
because it is actually following the rules.

Host: Yeah, we're trying to figure out what we have. We have to make a new, uh, a new eval
basically. You're too advanced. Like, you broke the test.

Yeah, you kind of broke the test. And, um, yeah, so now it's, it's a little weird. Externally, we
don't, you know, it's like obviously we want to portray to the world, "Hey, you know, we have this
great thing," and okay, we lose here. But like, but not really. And so I think we're going to try
to, you know, we're going to talk about this in more detail, this kind of entanglement problem,
because it's actually like a very interesting, more fundamental insight.

Interviewer: Yeah, it sounds like you're just building a completely different kind of company. Like,
the thread that comes up hearing everyone here is it using Playground feels like you're talking to a
graphic designer, which then in my head actually buckets you into just the companies in YC that are
really taking off are the ones that are replacing some form of labor. Um, which is just different to
how people talk about Midjourney, right? It's not just like a tool to play around with. This is
actually just going to be like the replacement for hiring a graphic design team, potentially, which
is like way more commercial, right?

Host: Yeah, yeah. I mean, we've been we've been searching for like, where is the utility? Where,
where, how are people using, you know, things like Midjourney? Um, and, uh, and I think that for me,
it's actually it's even simpler. It's just that I think we're just enabling the person to have more
control over the whole thing. Like, I always feel bothered, you know, when you're like, I produce
music, and so if I make a song, like, I have to go to a designer and say, "Can you make me album
art?" And then I only get like four variations of it. And then I feel badly asking for a fifth if I
don't like any of the four. But the more you just like put in control, the person that's actually
making the thing, they'll always, they'll be able to connect exactly the thing that they're looking
for with, you know, the core product or song or whatever they're making.

So Y Combinator, we're always, uh, telling founders, "Hey, you should talk to your users more." Or,
you know, and what you did was you had so many users you couldn't just talk to them. You needed to
look at how were they actually using it. And at some point, you realized, you know, somewhat
uncomfortably, that they were generating near porn, near porn.

Host: Yeah, we get a lot of near porn, uh, and porn. Um, and then, you know, I think people sort of
when they're exploring a space often run into that situation. Like, what happens when, you know, the
users that you're getting aren't the users you actually want?

Yeah. Me and my COO talked about this. Like, if we listened to what the users wanted, we would have
to build a porn company, potentially, which is not something that I think my wife would be happy
with or my mother. Um, it was kind of this tricky thing where you're like, "Listen to your users,
talk to your users." Uh, and, and look, I'm not saying everybody does that with image models for
sure. They don't. But, but a lot of them do. And so we had to kind of go ask ourselves, "Well, then
what can you do with these things?" And the answer was like, "Not much else, nothing big and
commercial enough."

We could make a cool website that people use. Um, and the problem is all the, all the, all the image
generator sites are played with this problem. And we all know it. We all know. And there are huge
safety problems. And you know, it turned out to be just like a business we didn't like. That's a
hard, like, that's like a hard thing. After, you know, 12, 18 months of working on something, and
you're just like, "Well, I don't really like this that much. And now what?"

And when we looked around for use cases, we were like, "Oh, all the use cases have all the big ones.
Practically all of them: logos, posters, t-shirts, bumper stickers. Everything, everything has text
because text is also a way to communicate with humans." That's why it became number one. Like, the
number one priority.

Interviewer: I mean, this isn't the first time that you've sort of confronted this issue before. You
know, in your prior startup, Mixpanel, which you built into a company that you know makes hundreds
of millions of dollars a year, one of the leaders in analytics, from a really young age. You know, I
think you started it when you were 19. And I remember because I met you when you first started it.
That was another moment where here's this brand new technology and there are sort of very commercial
use cases that you could build a real business on. And then there were other use cases. In that
case, I think it was, um, sort of fly-by-night gaming operations that would come and sort of pop up
on Facebook, steal a bunch of users, and then disappear. And you had to make some choices about who
you wanted your users to be. Like, do you want it to be people who can actually pay you money for a
real product over the long haul? Or sort of, "Oh, yeah, they're here and they're gone, and we can
make our graph go up"? Like, it's sort of a quandary that a lot of founders are facing. How did you
approach that?

Host: Yeah, I mean, I, that one's like burnt into my memory actually. Um, so we, you know, the
simple story was just that like we got all these gaming companies back in the gaming heyday. You
know, Zynga and Playdom and Slide, and all this stuff. And, um, and they would, we we were making so
much money off of them. But then they would die because they had bad retention or games just have
like a decay factor. And, uh, you could tell that they were going to die because the retention was,
that we saw it happening, you know? It's like all real time, uh, data on it.

And so, you know, one day I go to, I go to you one of my mentors is Max Levchin, and I interned for
him at his other company. And, and I was like, "Hey, you know, this thing is happening, and we have
all these competitors that are building gaming analytics tools or products. And I don't really know
how to compete. Feels a little weird to just go after gaming when it's like this weird thing that's
churny."

And he just looked at me and he was just kind of like, he's like, "What do you think is the biggest
market?" And I was like, "Probably not gaming. Probably like the rest of the internet, you know?"
And, uh, and mobile was like just starting. And we didn't really know. Like, the top free app in the
app store was like a mirror on mobile. So it was kind of like, uh, is mobile going to, maybe it'll
be there next year? I hope. And, but anyway, and he, and I, you know, so the rest, the internet. And
he said, "Well, if you're, you know, there's the name of our competitor, and he was just like, 'If
your competitor gets bought for $100 million tomorrow, uh, you know, that's focused on gaming, don't
cry about it. Then just go after the biggest market.'"

And, um, and that's what, when we did that, and then mobile went huge. It went so big and it
completely transformed. We got rid of all the gaming, all the gaming stuff, and that was like a 100%
the right decision.

So I think it's just like being kind of like ruthless almost about where the value is, with your own
users, with what you're doing. Like, all those things I think are like, is very, very important.

Interviewer: I mean, it sounds like you had to close a door, and then God came and opened a window
for you.

Host: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, we kind of have a similar problem where it's, you know,
our, the current, us, our current user base that we have is is not exactly, you know, know an
exciting thing we want to do as a team. And so then we're like hunting for where the rest of the
value is.

Interviewer: Yeah, that's a really important lesson. You, I mean, I guess that's like the super big
lesson here is you can choose your users or your customers, you know? Often your customers or users
choose you, and if you don't want them, it is, uh, a choice that you can make. And sometimes it
actually allows you to find the, uh, you know, global maximum instead of just the local maximum.

Host: Yeah, it's, you know, we're kind of faced the same decision. It's like a real-time decision
almost. Um, it's fun to talk about things when they work, when your decisions are right. So we'll
see, you know, years later if this is right. But you know, I think it's tough because, you know,
Midjourney is doing two, $300 million. But the biggest market is in graphic design, is probably
Canva, doing $2.3 billion. Do, and so we're just kind of like, "Well, forget it. Uh, let's go after
the biggest, most valuable thing in the world." And you know, not a lot of people know a lot about
Canva. I find in Silicon Valley most people know about Figma, but Canva makes vastly much more money
than Figma.

So by enabling everyone, so if you have this amazing, you know, AI graphics designer of sorts,
enabling like so much more of humanity, I find, I mean, I think a lot of people believe this, but I,
I do, I also believe this, which I think AI will certainly, it feels like it's expanding the pie of
all these markets, not like they're not the same size. I think most of the time, right? Like, you're
enabling more people to write code that otherwise couldn't, you know, that kind of thing.

Interviewer: I guess the interesting thing about Playground was also a previous more radical pivot
you had, because you had gone through YC twice. Yeah, so you went through with Mixpanel, which
became this successful company making hundreds of millions of dollars, then you went through it with
Mighty, Mighty M. Can you tell us about that second time going through YC and then what was it, and
then you pivoted into—yeah.

Host: So we, I did this combo browser, um, company called Mighty, where our goal was to try to like
stream a browser. And the real goal was to try to make a new kind of computer. And, um, we basically
did it. But the problem was is that, you know, we hit this wall where it was like, we didn't, I
didn't believe that it was going to be a new kind of computer anymore. I just couldn't make it more
than two times faster. And I just didn't feel like if I couldn't get like a 10x or 5x on this thing,
like, and or at least see that it could get a 10x, um, that it just, it wasn't a company that I
wanted to work on anymore.

I remember I had invested before I came back, of course, Y Combinator. And one of the big, uh, ideas
that really got me was that, uh, actually our MacBook Pros were really sucking at the time.

Interviewer: Yeah, they were.

Host: Yeah, there was no M1 at the time.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Host: And we actually, I don't think we even knew that Apple was going to release silicon yet. I
mean, it's interesting. I think that in Silicon Valley would maybe, um, underestimate how valuable
strategy actually is. Mainly because strategy is so fun and so interesting, and the MBAs who come
into our sector like immediately seize on that and just want, you know, I like, you need a strategy
person as like the, you know, as a co-founder. And it's like, "No, no, no. We don't actually need
that." But that's not to say that strategy is not necessary.

In this particular case, like, I think that we were trying to solve a real problem, which was our,
our browsers really sucked. And the cloud was getting very, very good. And then suddenly, you know,
the maze changed when, uh, when Apple released silicon.

Interviewer: Well, they clearly thought so too.

Host: So, you know, strategy was right in some sense. Like, the overarching problem of trying to
make our computers faster, they were able to make a chip. Yeah. But, but still, you know, even, you
know, even in the, even the face of the M1, we had kind of convinced ourselves like, "Well, it
doesn't really matter like the Mac only has like 8.3% market share, desktop market share, the rest
is Windows." And, um, you know, I even met, you know, the prior CEO of Intel, Bob Swan. And you
know, talk to him about like, "Yeah, why is Intel behind here?" And all that. And I was trying to
figure out like, "Why is AMD and Intel behind? Where is, where is it going? Is anyone even going to
get close to the M1 or not?"

And so I think one problem is that like wanting them to be behind is like non-ideal for your
company, right? Like, don't bet against macro. The problem is.

Interviewer: Yeah, you definitely don't want to bet against that. And then, and then I think the
second piece was I sat down with one of the engineers that works on V8, the browser engine, uh,
behind Chrome. And then I gave him like every imaginable idea, me or the team, had on figuring out
how to speed up the browser. And he had an answer to all of them. Once I realized that—

Interviewer: The team is basically focused on like 1% improvements and they had already tried
everything. I mean, that was like a very depressing moment. Like, I was like out of ideas, you know?
The people say, when is it the right time to pivot or change or whatever? Um, and I had just run out
of ideas, but I, you know, really wanted to like stick with it, uh, but I just couldn't figure out
another way to get it. We went as far as we started building a computer in the data center and we
had like figured out how to use like consumer CPUs in a data center legally with the right
architecture. And like, I think PG came over once and it was just like the sprawl of all these
components. Maybe we're building physical, we kind of building hardware. I learned major lessons at
MixPanel, but the one major lesson that I learned at Mighty was that it's so valuable to have a
tailwind for your company as opposed to a headwind. There were just so many obstacles in our way,
you know, whether it was the M1 or, um, you know, there's no real way to like change the fundamental
architecture of the browser. You know, like JavaScript is just innately run single-threaded in a
tab. We can't change that. With Playground, it feels like it's all tailwinds all the time, you know?
We just like wait and things get better, things get faster, cheaper, better, easier.

Host: The thing that's remarkable is you had this really impressive career with building a standard
SaaS business with MixPanel. You give it a try with the browser GPU and then you now kind of retool
yourself and are building this soda stable diffusion model. What was that journey like? How did you
retool yourself?

Interviewer: That was one of those things that is like so impressive. I just started learning. I
don't know. I took whatever AI courses were out there that I could take. Unfortunately, the
Carpathia courses didn't exist um back then, but I think, you know, at first I was trying to
actually build like a better AI ad bar in the browser, which now exists. Google just released that I
think, um, and uh, and this was before GPT-4. Like, I think we were talking to OpenAI. They were
like very helpful because I think they didn't have, you know, ChatGPT didn't exist yet, and we were
trying to figure out how to get that integrated in the address bar at low latency. And so I was like
learning AI, doing a like, learning AI how to do AI research and train models before all of that
happened. But I think something weird happened, which was in doing that and getting kind of
connected with like the folks that OpenAI and like learning these things, I ended up just getting to
see it happen. Like, I knew it was about to happen like earlier than other people. I got kind of
lucky, I guess. A lot of people probably remember the DALL-E 2 moment. That was like a crazy moment
where image generation, you know, really was exciting. And then so I just tried to, I just kept
learning and then, you know, I think Stable Diffusion came out like maybe I don't know, maybe I got
like I got access like two weeks before it came out. And so it was just like by being in the mix of
this thing, you just, you just, I got to see everything about to start. And so I think we were the
first AI image generation like website that you could like go to and sign up and you didn't have to
like run it manually on some GPU. And so that, I think that our website just took off because of
that. That was like the easiest thing, I think. MidJourney was still in Discord, right? So we're
like, what if you make a website? I didn't actually know that story. I mean, that's a great lesson
for any technical founder, right? Like, essentially you stumbled on the biggest tailwind of our
generation by just following technical things you found interesting.

Host: It's great.

Interviewer: Yeah, it is a little weird. After MixPanel, I actually tried to intern only at, I tried
to do like an internship at companies, and um, because I don't know, I was like wanting to do
something but not ready to start a company. And I only was trying to talk to AI companies. And uh, I
like interviewed at OpenAI and I like, they wanted me to come work five days a week, but I only want
to do three. And then like, somehow at the end of that, I made this huge mistake in I guess 2018
where um, I had decided that there was nothing interesting going on in AI because I was like
training and even then I was like training my own models. I was like trying to help a scooter
company keep the scooters to detect if they were on the sidewalk or on the road, um, because the
regulation in SF requires required them to do that. And I like learned all this AI stuff, went to
all these AI events, and uh, and then I just, yeah, I conclude there's nothing. And I started
Mighty. And I, and I was like just off by like three months. And so I kind of felt like I almost
feel redeemed in some sense, you know? Um, I don't know. It's it's so hard to like time these
things. How do you know whether you're early or late? And then for a long time you were behind on
the model, right? Uh, for for Playground. And I've just felt continuously behind, but I've now kind
of come to realize after like learning the history of like Microsoft and microprocessors. Like, I
don't know, it might just be like year two. This all still might be really, really early. We really
don't know where it's going.

Host: How does it feel to run Playground, which is sort of part startup, part research lab versus
just pure startup?

Interviewer: Well, one thing we try to do is uh, we try to differentiate on not trying to go after
AGI. That's one thing we try to uh, say we're not doing um, because there's lots of people doing
that. It feels really tractable, I guess. The research does, you know, where it's not always clear
whether research will be like that, you know? I I've kind of learned that you can't you can't do
research in a rush. So one big problem is that when you're building a startup, like you want to ship
everything, like you wanted to ship, you want to ship it today, you want to fix the bug, you want to
ship the feature, like you're just trying to move on such a fast pace. But that's not tenable with
research in the same way. Research is moving fast, but it's not like you ship. You can't ship your
new model. You can't build and ship your model in a week. And so I think that's been like really
challenging, and I've had to kind of adjust my brain for one team versus the other.

Host: Yeah, one thing I think is interesting about successful research labs in the past, if you look
at Bell Labs for example, it's almost like the the CEO of the lab's main responsibility is shielding
the lab from like the commercial interest that are pushing for like things now. But as CEO of
Playground, you're kind of both like protector of the researchers but you're also the commercial
interests. Like, how do you juggle those competing forces?

Interviewer: Yeah, I don't know that I've probably mastered yet by any means. But um, I think I
asked Sam Altman once, like, you know, to what degree he allowed the researchers at OpenAI to like
wander, I guess? So I just wasn't really sure, you know? Usually it's like there's a task and you do
it, but what about wandering? How does wandering make sense in a in a research or an engineer
engineering team? And um, he said there's like a, he's like, there's quite a bit of wandering. So I
took that to heart, and um, and so I let the research team kind of wander and get to a point where
they are able to show an impressive result, and then we kind of like, kind of start to like really
accelerate that. But until then, there's not much to do.

Host: Well, not all who wander are lost. I love that. That should be a t-shirt in right, make a, we
will add that as a template, y, we can link it below in the video. I'll be a Creator in the
Playground Marketplace. Love it. You were asking like, how do you like inter almost like, how do
these two teams integrate in a startup? And I think that we just like have a channel now where we
just see so much feedback that now the researchers can actually like look into the failure and they
can decide from themselves while wandering, do I want to fix that? That's surprising. Why did that
happen? Um, and so I want to try to like integrate these two because I think that that's like a
weird, that's a more differentiating factor these days. I think that that like the researcher
research labs are very lab-based and they don't necessarily, they're not always deeply looking into
real user behavior, what are they really trying to do? But sometimes it's just like, we need to get
to this, like we need to get a high score on this eval, and we got to put it in the paper, and then
we got to like get really good score for LLM Arena, and then there's like some KPI, you know, to do
that. But then, you know, does that thing matter? Does it correlate? Does the eval that we see out
in the world, does it strongly correlate to usefulness to users? Like, I still want the LLM to like
help me make rap lyrics, but there's no eval for that. So, you know, who will do that? How will that
happen? It's certainly possible to do that, but I, if you notice, I always pick on this rap lyrics
thing because to me it like belies a fundamental problem with how people are evaluating the models.
Because the model should be extremely good at it, but they're not.

Host: Maybe the problem is some of these, um, there's a gap between commercialization of research.
Because all these evals publicly are academic and very different use cases than if you wanted to go
beat Campa, let's say.

Interviewer: Yeah, I mean, I might be talking out of turn here, sorry to the LLM folks. But the, if
you go look at the evals for the language models, they're all like, you know, math, biology, legal
questions. It's no wonder that the biggest use case of ChatGPT is homework, because they, you know,
all the models are like basically hit these numbers, right? Initially, maybe they're different now.
They're probably more sophisticated now, but it's no wonder that the models are good at homework and
that's a huge category.

Host: So you made it to SODA. People are watching right now and they're just asking like, how do I
do it? What's your answer to that?

Interviewer: There's like this feeling that all you need is a lot of data and um, a lot of compute,
and you just, and then you just uh, you run, you train these models, and you'll get there, you know?
Uh, they'll just generalize and suddenly everything will be great. I think there are a lot of smart
software engineers, and so they fundamentally understand that these are the core components,
ingredients to make like this great model. But it's vastly more complex than this. And what I've, at
least what I've experienced, is that to get to SODA, you basically have to be maniacal about like
every detail of, um, you know, the model's like capability. For example, like you can like look at
text generation. There going to be some people that train their models and they get cool text
generation, but the kerning is off. Are you the kind of person that will care about the kerning
being off? Or are you the kind of person that is okay with it, like or you don't even notice it?
Like, do you have this just maniacal sense? Like, we look at skin texture. Like, my eyes feel burnt
out, basically, from looking at like the smallest little skin texture, you know, smoothness. We like
talk about these things as a research team day in and day out. We like argue about it. To build
these SODA models, you have to be so, you care so much about, in our world, it's image quality, and
and you know, we even look at like little small things. Like, if there's even a slight film grain
and it's missing, we go, oh, the prompt, the captioning model is bad, not good enough. We need to be
better at this. And I think this maniacal mindset, I think allows you, if you do this a hundred
times, the model extrapolate even more. I think people don't quite internalize like extrapolation of
all of these dimensions together and how they work together to make everything better. Like, you
don't know how making one thing better here will impact like another thing over there. We can't,
it's hard to understand that, but I think that that's what's what that's what's required to get to a
SODA model, and it is possible. It is possible. It is possible. It's not easy though. It's really
hard.

Host: Yeah, well, Suhail, thanks a lot for coming on the Lightcone. That's all we have time for, but
you can try Playground right now at playground.com uh, or in the App Store, Android, iOS. Uh, and
this is actually the biggest flex you didn't have any waitlists. It was just available on day one.
