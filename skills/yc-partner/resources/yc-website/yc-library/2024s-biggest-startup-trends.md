## Transcript

Gary: The wildest thing right now is you can start a company that can make tens of millions of
dollars literally in 24 months and you can do it for potentially, you know, two million, five
million a year ago I remember many of the startups in the batch would get sort of enterprise proof
of concepts or pilots in particular and there was a lot of cynicism around whether any of those
pilots would translate into real revenue fast forward a year I think we have all firsthand
experienced that these pilots have turned into like real revenue it's still early days honestly like
it you know we sort of breathe a sigh of relief right now in 2024 but it's anyone's game honestly
like these things are moving so quickly.

Gary: Welcome back to another episode of the Light Cone I'm Gary this is Jared and Diana and
collectively we funded companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars right at the beginning. So
2024, what a year. How are you feeling about this, Jared?

Jared: Pretty great. I think this is the year that everything broke in favor of startups. What I've
been thinking about a lot recently is when ChatGPT launched two years ago now, the immediate
consensus view was all of the value would go to OpenAI and very specifically. Do you all remember
when they announced the GPT or the ChatGPT store?

Diana: Yeah, like I remember the consensus was everything that was built on top of ChatGPT was a GPT
wrapper and the app store was just going to be released and crush every single person trying to
build an AI application and OpenAI would be a ginormous company but there'd be no opportunity for
startups.

Jared: Sounds kind of ridiculous to say that now because um who even remembers the ChatGPT store?

Diana: Exactly. The ChatGPT store itself was a nothing burger but like more importantly what are the
big AI applications today? Like I'd say outside of ChatGPT itself the breakout consumer application
is Perplexity. The breakout enterprise application is probably Glean. Maybe in legal tech you have
CaseTech, you have Harvey, Pruma, you have Photo Room. Like there's the point being there are many
many applications that have been built not by OpenAI. It's been a great time to build startups.

Gary: Yeah, the wildest thing right now is you can start a company that can make tens of millions of
dollars uh literally in 24 months from zero and uh you can do it for potentially you know two
million, five million. That's sort of the story of one of these companies, Opus Clip, which never
had to raise a real Series A and that's something that we sort of see across the YC community as
well.

Diana: Yeah, I think that's um a particularly important point that you can do it as a startup
without raising tons of capital because post the GPT store launch I then remember uh Anthropic and
Claude emerged and the consensus view for a while was all of the value is going to go to one of
these foundation model companies and that the only way you can compete in AI is to raise huge
amounts of money um either because you've got venture capital or you're Amazon or Facebook or Google
um with tons of cash already but that if you weren't one of the big foundation models um there would
be no value and the applications built on top of these things would either be built by the
foundation model companies themselves or just not be that valuable. Again, something that turned out
to be completely not true right. And in particular what drove that is open source like the weird
series of events where the weights are being leaked and like Meta just like rolling Torch.

Jared: Yeah, I kind of forced the hand for uh Meta to launch Llama, which was funny and people
thought oh it was just this cool open source model but it was 18 months behind OpenAI and people
started doing a lot of derivative work out of it like Vicuna and all these other animals related to
llamas that came out and it took the uh llamas. One of the companies at YC as well that enabled
people to do uh local kind of Docker development like models running on device. It was pretty cool
but people didn't think that um they were going to be able to catch up and the thing that changed
from 2023 to 2024 is that during the summer it was a turning point. It was the first time that the
top foundation model in all the rankings benchmarks was Llama and that was a shock to the community.

Gary: Yeah, so it turns out choice uh matters and choice means that it's not as much about the
model. I think the model still matters quite a lot um but once you have choice in model it means you
can't have the sort of idea of monopoly pricing and you have that model you're Perplexity also has
that model but all the other things seem to end up mattering a lot more which is product, your
ability to sell, your ability to actually adjust to user feedback, your ability to get to zero
churn. All of those suddenly become far more important than capturing a light cone of all future
value through the model right. A very specific way I I felt this is I remember a year ago working
with startups in the batch that are essentially building model routers just like an API to call like
a specific model and I remember the um a lot of the motivation for that at the time was uh reducing
cost. It was like oh like you don't want to just like burn up all of your ChatGPT calls you want to
spread them out across like various different models and the the the argument against that was just
oh like the cost of all this stuff is going down to zero anyway like there's no value to be had in
being like a model router and no one wants to build their applications with a model router they're
all just going to call whatever is the best model. I think fast forward a year like that's totally
not true like from what I can tell the the model router was actually a really great entry point into
just building sort of a new stack for building LLM powered apps and most of the the applications
we're seeing I think they just don't want to be beholden to a specific model. Does that map with
what you've seen?

Jared: Yeah, actually one of the things we've seen now in the fall batch that just presented at demo
day which was one of the trends that shifted from summer 24 and winter 24 was precisely what you're
saying. Companies started to use multiple models for the applications like the best one for speed at
some point because sometimes you need to parse a lot of the input very quickly, it's fine if it's a
bit more lossy and then you need the bigger model to handle the more complex task so a lot of
companies in fall 24 have this actually multiple model architecture to use the best one for the best
task which is similar to the concept of the model router but it was uh the idea evolved instead of
being being more of a routing it was more of an orchestration. I think a concrete example we gave uh
a couple episodes ago was uh Camper was a company you work with. They use the fastest model for
parsing like PDFs and the more complex ones they use 01 and that's that's how it's done and other
companies that's doing uh fraud detection they have this concept of a like a junior risk analyst
where they just use like a fast and easy GPT-4 Mini and and then they use the bigger one with like
o1 or the other example is um I think Cursor talks about it in their episode with uh Lex Fridman.
They also have this complex multi-architecture with multiple models and this is why it works well.
It's like they do one very specific for predicting what you're going to type next but one for
understanding the whole code base. So very different tasks. So that's definitely happening now.

Gary: Yeah, the other thing that uh popped up for fall batch there's a company I'm working with um
called Variant and uh what they're trying to do is take basically state-of-the-art open-source LLM
models that can do code gen and then teach them aesthetics so uh starting with icon generation and
so they built this huge sort of post-training workflow that should work on you know as the open-
source models get smarter and better at code broadly they can just you know take the next version of
that and then uh take their post-training architecture and data set and then basically teach a given
model aesthetics so what a certain thing is supposed to look like and uh not in a diffusion sort of
way but actually at the SVG level and we think SVG will actually translate into all kinds of
aesthetics so it's an interesting approach and like one of the newer ones and that post-training is
a whole coherent way to sort of skip the whole idea that um all the value is like accrued into the
model especially because of open source to your point. The other thing I I've been having flashbacks
to is a year ago I remember many of the startups in the batch would get sort of enterprise proof of
concepts or pilots in particular and there was a lot of cynicism around whether any of those pilots
would translate into real revenue um lots of parallels to crypto and how anytime there's some new
interesting technology blockchain more specifically than crypto but anytime there's a new technology
enterprises always want to run pilots and POCs because it's someone's job to like check off yeah we
did the like hot new technology thing. The chief innovation officer must have his VI. We've spoken
about this one of one of our episodes I think and yeah fast forward a year I think we have all
firsthand experienced that these pilots have turned into like real revenue and if anything the
startups in the YC batch now are going to sell into real enterprises faster than they have before
and are ramping up revenue and reaching milestones like a million dollars ARR faster than I've
suddenly ever seen.

Diana: Yeah, the fall batch just did this actually again which is actually the first time I think we
noticed it was actually the summer batch of this year and uh one of the funnier things that we
realized was do you remember when Paul Graham uh would tell us how fast you needed to grow during
the YC batch? Ten percent a week, ten percent a week and uh the wild thing is in aggregate uh across
both you know summer and fall batches that's what those batches did.

Gary: Wow, so which I don't think ever happened before over the course of YC, yeah three X over the
course of YC, which I don't think has ever actually happened on average. It was only the best
companies that did that which is the top quartile or something right?

Diana: So the companies are better. The general thing that is true is just that the time it's taking
to reach a hundred million in annual revenue is trending down.

Gary: Yeah, and not only that um we had dinner with Ben Horowitz recently and remember he was saying
when they started Andreessen Horowitz the common understanding was that in any given year there'd
only be 15 companies that year that would even make it to a hundred million a year revenue and uh
they said they ran the numbers the last 20 years and every decade the number of companies that could
actually make it to a hundred million went up by 10x. So what was 15 per year maybe 20 years ago, I
mean we're talking about 1,500 companies a year that have a real shot at actually making that number
and when you combine that with what we're seeing in the summer and fall batches it's not that
surprising. And Jared had a really good argument on our last episode about how vertical AI is going
to enable this to have thousand 500 plus companies to bloom.

Jared: Yeah, that's why it's growing so fast. It's because the value prop to companies of these
products is so incredibly strong that like they're just flying off the shelves cuz like I companies
are smart and they can do an ROI calculation and when the ROI is fantastic all these all these
truisms that people believe about enterprise sales cycles and like quite a taste to get big
enterprise deals go out the window because companies are smart and they'll make rational decisions
you know. Har there there's another way that this broken favor of startups that I was thinking about
um it's hard to even remember now but a year ago one of the things that people said a lot was that
these LLMs are not reliable enough to deploy in the enterprise they hallucinate. That was why a lot
of people said like the these pilots and POCs like won't translate into real contracts is because
yeah it's too risky of a technology um for people to actually deploy.

Diana: Yeah, and not only is it translated into real revenue but translating into real deployments
that are like being used at large scale you know doing thousands of tickets a day and I think it's
because we've learned how to make the agents reliable via the kinds of techniques that Jake talked
about when he was here and just the all this infrastructure has grown up around around the bottles.
It's enabled people to make them reliable.

Gary: Yeah, that's actually a big trend uh this year is this concept of uh thinking of AI more as
agentic. That is a term that kind of bubbled up a lot this year. It was not in the bubbled space of
conversation last year. Last year was more about a lot of things that were kind of very chat-like
chat. I mean that was kind of the riff on it but now remixed into a bunch of agents for XYZ and we
just I mean you just put out a great explainer video about computer use from Claude but just the
capability of the models keeps pushing in the direction of just being able to do like complex
multistep things and actually take over your computer and call other applications and and perform
complex tasks that just didn't seem possible a year ago.

Diana: What about regulation? Seems like we sort of dodged a bullet there with uh 1047 and uh it
looks like some of the Biden EO uh is not that likely to survive the Trump White House. TBD what
that means in the longer term but certainly one of the things that we were very worried about was
that some certain amount of math beyond a certain level would suddenly become illegal or require
registration at your local office. It's certainly been a weird time to be in tech because I've never
experienced um software and technology intersecting with politics so much and in particular I'm not
used to genuinely caring about national politics affecting startups in a YC batch or just you know
companies that are less than a year old but it did really. It did really for a moment was worrying.
It wasn't clear whether startups would actually be able to build innovative AI applications versus
suffering from regulatory capture from OpenAI and a few big players. We're obviously very glad it
broke in the favor of startups. Seems like we're still in the early game right?

Gary: I mean, I mean it's very easy to see that um the platforms themselves really will or could
possibly resemble you know the Win32 monopoly right? Windows uh has access to the APIs they in fact
know all the stats about what's working on their platforms and guess what they can build it into
their platform you know. We sort of breathe a sigh of relief right now in 2024 but um you know it's
anyone's game honestly like these things are moving so quickly. I wouldn't totally breathe your last
sigh of relief yet you know it's we we got to keep working on this.

Jared: Okay so it's clearly been a great year for startups um what else has been happening? Who else
has it been um a great year for? Do we think there certainly been some big funding rounds right?
Like OpenAI unsurprisingly has raised huge amounts of capital. Scale, yeah even within YC though
we've seen like Scale AI has really broken out this year. Six billion for OpenAI, one billion for uh
Scale, a billion dollars for SSI, the new Ilias Sager startup Scale. I think is just worth talking
about because it's such a classic startup story. I mean you were there in the early days right? You
interviewed them for YC um what um tell us what the idea was that they interviewed with and how they
ended up landing on what you know is probably one of the best startup ideas of the last 10 years.
The fun thing about the Scale.AI story is that it is the sort of epitome of the like classic YC
startup story there's other kinds of startups that

Jared: Get started. You know, like Scale.ai, for example—that's not a typical YC startup story where
some very well-established people raise a billion dollars with like a PowerPoint pitch. But Scale.ai
is like the classic story of how young programmers can just gradually build a $10 billion company
over time by being smarter and harder working than anybody else. And so yeah, when Alex interviewed
at YC, he wasn't working on anything related to AI. It was a completely different idea. And the idea
for Scale.ai kind of got pulled out of him by the market. And it's actually still like several
pivots, because the original idea at YC didn't have anything to do with AI. And then for a long
time, he was basically doing data labeling for the self-driving car companies.

Host: They applied as I remember, they applied like a healthcare-related idea.

Jared: Yeah, it was a website for booking doctor's appointments.

Host: Okay, cool. And then they pivoted during the batch. Um, do you remember how they came up with
the data labeling idea? Because this is supposed to be in—was this 2016?

Jared: Yeah, the way they came up with the data labeling idea was that Alex had worked at Quora, and
Quora had to do some data labeling for like moderation and stuff. And so at the time, the big data
labeling service was Amazon Mechanical Turk, and they were deemed unbeatable because they were run
by Amazon and Amazon could throw infinite money at it. It was always at scale—it was at quite large
scale already. But Alex had a unique insight, which is he actually used Mechanical Turk at Quora,
and he knew that it kind of sucked to actually use it. And so he had this sort of unique insight on
the world, and so he just tried to build a better Mechanical Turk, basically the version he would
have wanted when he was at Quora. And as I remember it, really their early traction came almost
entirely from one customer—Cruise, right?

Host: Yes, which needed to do tons of data labeling on all the images that the cars were taking as
they were driving around San Francisco. You got to like draw a circle around the traffic light and
things like that. And the cool thing about Scale is that they've actually caught two waves. So they
accidentally caught the first wave of all these self-driving car companies, because ML took off at
that time. In computer vision, there was just an unprecedented demand for labeled data for training
sets that just hadn't existed before. And so they were able to ride that wave. And then as that wave
was cresting, LLMs got big, and all of these companies needed to do RLHF at very large scale, and
Scale was just perfectly positioned to move into that business as well.

Jared: Yeah, I think the Scale story is so interesting because it was pre-LLM. It was clear a multi-
billion dollar business anyway. And with LLM, it caught the LLM wave, which is now priced into
probably, it's going to be like a hundred billion dollar plus company. And I'm seeing that at the
ground level too, where many companies I had that maybe finished the batch—even pre-batch—didn't
have an idea, pivoted into an AI idea that's taking off. Like, I'm just seeing much more success in
founders who waited out and can find an idea that they just couldn't before.

Host: I have a company from a year ago. They proved throughout the batch they couldn't find a great
idea. It actually took them six months after the batch until they realized one of their parents ran
a dentist office. So he just decided to go hang out at the office to see if there was anything he
could automate. And they just ended up building an AI back office for dentist offices. And now it's
just like their week-over-week growth is fantastic. It's doing really, really well. And I'm seeing
lots of cases like that spring up.

Jared: Definitely seeing that as well. I think there's something about the advantage of having all
these very hardcore young technical founders that are willing to kind of just bet the farm and go
all in on just a little bit of a glimmer of, "Oh, this is where the future is going to be. Let me
just try it." And then it actually ends up working.

Host: I just heard with the dentist. I have a lot of teams that pivoted as well into different
spaces where they kind of found that glimmer, like, "Oh, computer use came out," and I have a couple
companies that are working and betting and going in that direction, and it's like working well. I
mean, it's still early—I mean, this is just a Fall batch—but that's cool too.

Jared: Okay. So what are some of the actual trends that we've seen? What are some of the specific
trends and waves that startups have been riding coming out of the batches?

Host: Voice AI is something we've talked about. It's clearly maybe the most promising vertical for
AI right now in terms of just ROI traction. Do you think voice is a winner-take-all, or will it be
something that has sort of a hundred different verticals that are very tailored to those specific
verticals?

Jared: That's literally one of the questions I get from some of our voice AI startups themselves.
They're like, "Should I be going horizontal, or should I just continue to grow within my vertical?"
It feels to me like voice itself—voice is, I just like, it touches everything, and there's so many
different applications for it that you can—there's probably infinite applications to build where
voice is the interesting element of it. I mean, things that just spring to mind like language
learning applications—I'm sure there's not going to be just one really cool voice AI-powered
language learning application. Probably going to be multiple of them. Remote work, like
teleconferencing—there's probably a whole other area where there's interesting things to do with
voice AI. And even within customer support, we highlighted a number of companies we talked about
last time. Company name, Pare, Cap, uh—

Host: Yeah, it turns out that customer support is not really one vertical. There's like many
different flavors of customer support, and they're like very different on the inside once you get
into the details. Because I think there's very specific types of workflows you need to do per
industry. And that's to the point of why vertical AI agents are going to really flourish. I mean,
same thing for bots. It's just very different workflows if you're building the—I don't know—the
voice agent to do customer support for an airline, very different than doing it for a bank, very
different than doing it for a B2B SaaS company, etc.

Jared: Yeah, I guess that question of is there going to be pure horizontal integration? It's sort of
like saying, "Will there only be one website?"

Host: Yeah, or it'd be like saying there's just going to be both. It'll be horizontal infrastructure
companies that do really well and vertical applications, because to say otherwise would be like
saying, "Oh, like Stripe powers payments on the internet and it's also just going to have all the
most valuable applications that accept payments on the internet." It's just not how it works.
There's enough value in just being the horizontal infrastructure layer. So I'm sure there'll be
great voice AI companies that just make it really easy for you to build your own voice AI
application, while there'll also be hundreds of really valuable vertical apps.

Jared: What are, what are some other trends that we've seen besides voice? We were talking about
robotics earlier. There certainly, we are certainly working with more founders building robots this
year than I think any year ever. What's driving that?

Host: I have a YC app team that's called Weave Robotics that they're going to try to ship a real
robot in 2025. It costs about $65-70,000, but that's actually what it costs to have the actuators
and the safety needed to actually have it work in your home. I think it's driven by this idea that
the LLM itself can be sort of the consciousness of the robot—like, "Am I doing this thing that my
owner needs me to do? You know, how do I actually interact with them and the other people in the
household?" But it's funny because then the voice, language, action model that might actually do a
certain thing like fold laundry—that's almost tool use inside of the broader LLM consciousness. So I
feel like that's one of the things that I'm excited to see, you know, will it really work? And I
think we're going to find out this year.

Jared: I guess the way I think about it, robotics is basically half AI and half hardware. Half of
the equation is starting to work well. The hardware is still hard. The hardware is still very
expensive.

Host: Yeah, there's still some evidence that being able to actually do laundry, for instance, like
that might be one of the first things that gets shipped. I think the dream case for startups is
going to be that you can build just the AI or the software piece of it and run it on commodity
hardware and do really great things. The opposite case would be if the two things—if you need to be
good at the hardware and the software and they're coupled together and need to produce both—and you
would expect Tesla to be the obvious winner in the space. And it remains to be seen. I'm pretty
optimistic. We have multiple companies I feel are trying to be creative on how to run the models on
commodity hardware for specific use cases. It still feels early. It feels like robotics hasn't quite
hit its like ChatGPT moment yet.

Jared: Maybe the moment is self-driving cars. They've been working in San Francisco. I don't think
it's talked about enough. People who don't live in San Francisco, or like, often don't realize the
extent to which these are fully deployed in San Francisco and regular people are riding them every
single day.

Host: Yep, I saw Tony from DoorDash recently, and he said he exclusively uses Waymo like everywhere.
I live in Palo Alto and have no option for it, but I would love to. It'd be amazing. I mean, the
wild thing is there are only a few thousand of these deployed right now in the entire world and in
Frisco.

Jared: Yeah. What about big flops for 2024?

Diana: Uh, you know, I seem to remember that we started one of our Lightcone episodes all wearing
Apple Vision Pros and Quests, and we have not talked about AR since. Diana, what happened?

Diana: Uh, it hasn't happened. There's this moment for a lot of the hardware that needs to be a lot
more lightweight. Like, we need to get to this form factor, but there's actually constraints with
physics to fit all that hardware in such a small form factor in order to have enough compute and the
optics to fit is just super challenging. And I think there's still more actual engineering and
physics that needs to be discovered. And that's it. I think the algorithms are there, but it's just
lots of really hard hardware and optics problems. It's a tough chicken-and-egg problem because
there's not enough hardware in people's hands for it to be worth it for app developers to build
apps. And so there's not enough apps for people to want to buy the hardware. And I feel like the
people who did buy—like the killer application so far seems to be using it as a really large
monitor. Um, and it does work very well for that.

Host: You've actually retained as a user, Gary, right?

Gary: Yeah, it's great for watching movies. Yeah, maybe the one device that I think actually has
been playing and actually feels good is actually the Meta Ray-Ban. It doesn't have any of the actual
displays, but I really like it for the audio and voice, and one workflow I've been trying out is
actually using the Meta Ray-Ban and connect it to any of the voice modes for either ChatGPT or
Claude and kind of have a conversation with it about a topic.

Diana: Oh, I haven't tried that. That's an interesting idea.

Gary: Yeah, yeah. That's a great idea. That is like a fun thing that I've been doing and just
chatting with myself—maybe look a little bit like a crazy person while you're walking—but it's been
fun to kind of learn about different topics.

Jared: Should we talk about AI coding? 2024 was the year that AI coding really broke out.

Host: Yep, and we had the majority of YC founders now use Cursor or other AI IDEs. They just like
exploded over the summer. Devon proved that you could like fully automate large programming tasks.

Jared: Yeah, all that was this year. That was pretty wild. Replace agents continue to improve. Like,
I hear more anecdotal stories of people building Replit apps on like their way home from work being
really impressed. Like, Replit took this technology and popularized it among like non-technical
people for the first time. That's really crazy. And even more lower-technical version is Anthropic's
Artifact, where you can actually prototype very simple apps and chat with Claude to build really
fine simple front pages. And then you can prototype stuff as a PM and show it to your engineering
team, and it's like a full-fledged working version.

Host: Yeah, it's wild because it just means that one person can do so much more. And do you think
it's going to change the nature of how startups are actually hiring? Are you seeing this yet? Like,
some of the founders I've met who recently raised their seed rounds coming out of YC, um, they're
not really approaching it how maybe the classic advice would teach them. In the past, you might say,
"Let me try to find, you know, let me try to hire more people." Like, you know, there are certain
tasks that normally I have to find, you know, the person who did it at my competitor who did all of
customer success. And I need to find that person who's under the person who runs that function, and
I've got to hire that person and promote them, and they're going to come with all this knowledge and
people networks. Some people are saying sort of the opposite, which is, "I'm going to get my
software engineers to write more processes that use LLMs upfront," and you know, I probably will end
up needing to hire that person, but maybe after the Series B or C and not right now.

Jared: Yeah, I think I've seen that as well with companies after the batch where they're looking for
engineers that have more upside and they're really fully native with an AI coding stack. And part of
one of the clever interview checks I've seen is people do pair programming and watch them use the
tools, and you can really tell if someone really has tinkered with them. It's actually an engineer
cut that is not only good at coding but also prompting and telling when the AI output is not
correct.

Host: I think the part of reading and evaluating the output of all these AI coding agents is
actually a lot more critical.

Gary: Yeah, there's been an interesting controversy this past year about AI coding agents and
programming interviews because AI coding agents basically broke the standard programming interviews
that companies have been doing for years. Actually, Harj, I'm curious what you think about this,
since you ran a programming interview company. I mean, I guess the interesting debate is whether you
should penalize or prevent people who are interviewing at your company from using Cursor or one of
these tools to ace your programming interview, or whether you should just lean into it and adapt and
test to see how productive they are.

Harj: I mean, I generally think the way these things tend to go is more in that direction—that I
think it will just become you'll just be measured on your absolute output and the bar will go up. I
think like Stripe, for example, were early on this about a decade or so ago where they recognized
that so much of what they needed their programmers to do would be building web applications and web
software and not doing hard CS problems. And so the industry shifted away from the Google-style
interview of lots of computer science problems and whiteboarding to just give someone a laptop and
make them build like a to-do app in like four hours. So I think we'll just see the same thing happen
where people just—the industry will just adjust and you'll just be interviewed using these tools and
just be expected to do a lot more in like a two-hour interview than

Harj: You are today. To your point, Gary, around just the startups—like, maybe how many people they
need to hire or just like how they scale—it seems too early to see like dramatic effects on that
yet. But one thing that I'm interested in is, uh, so watched an interview with Jeff Bezos recently
and he said that, well, one, he's back at Amazon working on AI, and two, that apparently Amazon
itself has like a hundred or maybe it was a thousand—it was a surprisingly large number of internal
LLM-powered applications, presumably to just run Amazon. The last time Amazon took something it ran
for internal infrastructure and released it to the world was AWS, which completely changed how
startups are built. So I'm curious to see if they have interesting applications to run Amazon
internally that they'll just release out and suddenly like there'll be new stacks to just build and
scale your companies on. And we'll see the whole—something that we've talked about in recent
episodes—of the ten-person, the one-person unicorn. One of the applications they did talk about is
they did this giant migration for an old version of programming language. Whenever you need to
upgrade different versions of database, et cetera, it's like a lot of work, and they use LLMs for
it. It was like changing hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and it would have taken an
engineering project of six months or more. It was done in weeks. I mean, Amazon's just such a
perfect use case for like LLM-powered agents doing back office processes. They must have just like
absolute gold mine of opportunities.

Gary Tan: And they just launched their big foundation model actually that is starting to be top in
some of the benchmarks as well. So I think they're trying to be another contender through this race.

Host: That's interesting because, uh, like from the bottom up—like, certainly from some of the
people who still work at Amazon, maybe right out of college—many of them do not have access to LLMs
or are actually barred from using it from in their day-to-day. So, you know, maybe that's one of the
downsides of organizations when they get big enough. Um, you know, the future is already here, but
it is not evenly distributed, even within the same organization.

Harj: Think, but that boat sort of, well, for both open source and sort of self-hosting LLMs, like,
I—it's on my to-do list to build my own stack of Apple Minis and run Llama on my own little cluster
on my desk. I bought all the hardware to build my own machine, but then we had a baby, and it hasn't
happened. At some point, I've been pretty excited in that—you know, YC has been operating back in
person at San Francisco for some time. But we got a real live demo day—yeah, all the way back. So no
more Zoom demo days, no more Zoom alumni demo day. You know, we did alumni demo day right here in
this office, right, downstairs. That was awesome. And then we took over the Masonic Center, and
twelve hundred investors all in one room. It was actually really great for the founders, I thought,
because it was about a third as many founders as the summer batch and it was more than two
times—maybe three times—the number of investors that had come to our investor reception party. So it
was like a ratio of ten investors for one company, roughly. So I think all of them had a really good
time. I'd almost forgotten how great the energy of an in-person demo day is. Like, it's just not
something that you can replicate over Zoom. The YC demo days also always acted as the de facto
investor reunion in Silicon Valley because it's the one event that all the investors would reliably
show up at. And so they were really excited that we had brought it back because when we weren't
doing it, there was no equivalent event—sort of the homecoming for Silicon Valley.

Gary Tan: Yeah, so now it's, you know, four times a year, and it's the one time that all the top
early-stage investors in the world are going to come back to San Francisco for hopefully that week's
festivities culminating in our demo day. So it's a real celebration. It feels like Silicon Valley in
general is back. That's certainly another theme of 2024. Certainly, the late-stage startups that
we've been meeting with and speaking to this year—one of the highest priority items has been
figuring out how to get everyone back in person, back into the office. Think like the era of "it's
going to be remote forever" is definitely gone.

Host: I certainly say good riddance.

Gary Tan: Yeah, exactly right. And then, uh, like yeah, in person is back, and then San Francisco is
back. Like, a lot of thanks to you. The elections recently seem to have gone well. Like, there's a
lot of optimism I feel around San Francisco, and, and yeah, we have a new mayor. Uh, we're hoping
that he does the right things, and, um, you know, we have a very thin moderate majority on the Board
of Supervisors, but we did get rid of some of the worst people who created a doom loop in San
Francisco. So I'm optimistic. You know, we didn't get everything we wanted, but it's tracking in the
right direction. And I think as in startups, as in politics, you always—you know, way overestimate
what you will get done in one year, but you always way underestimate what's going to happen in ten
years. I think it's going to take ten years, it's going to take twenty years, but, um, just as
startups went from fifteen companies a year to that could possibly make it to one hundred million a
year to fifteen hundred in any given year—knock on wood—um, that, you know, I think San Francisco
needs to be the beacon for all the smartest people in the world. And that's actually probably the
thing that I'm most hopeful for is that we can actually just keep building. So from all of us to all
of you watching, happy holidays, and we'll see you in the new year.
