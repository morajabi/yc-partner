## Transcript

Host: With AI agents, there is no incumbent product. And so that, I think, is why you're seeing the
FTE model taking off because there's so much product discovery to do. You want to drive the contract
size up. So you're doing more and more valuable work for this customer and also for future
customers. The FTE model effectively is doing things that don't scale at scale.

Host: Hello and welcome back to another episode of the Lightcone. Gary wasn't feeling great today
and couldn't be here, but we're thrilled to be joined by Bob McGrew. Bob was an early engineer at
PayPal, an early executive at Palantir, and was recently Chief Research Officer at OpenAI, where he
led the development of ChatGPT, GPT-4, and the O1 reasoning model. Now he's exploring the future of
AI and has an exciting new role with the US Army that we'll get to in a bit. Bob, thanks so much for
being here.

Bob McGrew: It's great to be here.

Host: So Bob, I've been particularly excited to sit down with you to talk about the forward deployed
engineer model because this is a topic that keeps coming up in our lives. It is a really hot topic
in Silicon Valley right now and especially among the AI agent companies that we've talked about on
this podcast a lot. You were in the room when it all got started and so you know, like, you're
exactly the right person to explain it. You were actually telling me a funny story. You were at an
AI conference that YC organized a few months ago and you expected that all the founders would come
up to you to talk to you about, you know, inventing ChatGPT and instead what all of these AI startup
founders wanted to talk to you about was the Palantir forward deployed engineer model.

Bob McGrew: Well, and it's really true. It hasn't just been that one conference. As I've been
advising startups this last year, I would say that a lot of them are pretty much exclusively trying
to learn how the FDE strategy works.

Host: Yeah, so there's this intense fascination and it's super timely because it's actually become,
I think, the dominant way that the AI agent startups are organizing themselves. I was looking
earlier today and if you look at the YC job board, there's over a hundred YC startups that are
hiring for a job with the title "forward deployed engineer," and that's up from basically zero three
years ago. Perhaps before we get really into it, for anybody who doesn't already understand, can you
just explain what a forward deployed engineer is and how it's relevant today?

Bob McGrew: So a forward deployed engineer is someone, typically technical and an engineer, who sits
at the customer site and fills the gap between what the product does and what the customer needs.

Host: And how does this play out in practice?

Bob McGrew: You'll have a product and you go to a new customer. You start working with a new
customer and the problem that they want you to solve is not a problem that you've ever solved
before, but you believe that it's one that with a little bit of work, maybe a lot of work, you can
solve for this particular customer and you'd be making a huge impact for them. You'd be delivering
an outcome to them that would be extremely valuable for them. So you take the product that you have
and the FTE, with help from the product team, figures out how to deliver that outcome, how to build
that use case, how to deliver the piece of software that you've built in a way that actually works
for the customer.

Host: To go all the way back to the beginning, you were there at Palantir when this whole model that
is now like exploding in Silicon Valley was invented. Can you talk about how it all got started?

Bob McGrew: The interesting way to think about the beginning of Palantir is that when we got
started, the focus of our company was to build software for the intelligence community, specifically
software for spies. And so one of the challenges in building software for spies is that I don't know
any spies. You probably don't know any spies either.

Host: Nope.

Bob McGrew: And if you happen to find a spy and you go and ask them, "So, what is it exactly that
you do?"—

Host: Um, they're not usually going to tell you.

Bob McGrew: And so we had to take an approach that was sort of very unusual at the time, but
effectively we started by building a demo and we took that demo to potential customers in the
intelligence community. And, you know, Stefan Cohen very famously did this, one of the founders of
Palantir. And he showed them the demo and he said, "You know, well, what do you, what do you think?"
And they said, "Well, this is terrible. This isn't related to what we do at all." And he said, "Oh,
well, how would you like it to be different?" And then, you know, they would say, "Oh, well, could
you make this change and this change?" He's like sitting there writing all of this down. So far,
this story feels very much like you would the standard advice you would give to founders today,
right? That you have to go, you have to make something people want. You have to get out of the
building. You have to go talk to customers. I think we were doing this back in the mid-2000s. And
so, you know, there's a little bit of that meme where, like, I spent years mastering this technique
and Paul Graham just tweeted it out for everybody.

Host: Hmm.

Bob McGrew: But the thing that changes, and that really causes the FDE strategy, is that what you
expect and the standard thing that you expect is that you spend a lot of time early on, you know,
doing things that don't scale, going out and visiting customers, getting very close to the
customers, and then you discover product-market fit. And once you discover product-market fit, you
know, if you—and this is classic, you know, if you read "Crossing the Chasm" or any of these
books—once you discover product-market fit, you do something entirely different. So, you know,
instead of going, staying deep with the customers, doing as much as you can to really understand the
customer, instead you want to embrace distance from your customer and all you want to focus on is
scaling. How do you sell more? How do you treat all customers exactly the same? And you know, I want
to say that if you're in a business where this is working for you, that's great. Don't do the FDE
strategy. You have been given an amazing gift. If you have the opportunity to just scale, treat all
the customers the same, go ahead and do that. But it didn't work for us and I think this is where
Sham Sankar, who's a very early employee, you know, now I think the president and CTO of Palantir,
he really invented the FDE strategy. And the basic thing we found was that the customers that we
had—the product that they needed was slightly different at every place. And so we moved from one
customer, building a product for them, we went to the next customer, we saw they had something
slightly different. And instead of sort of building two products or building the exact right feature
for each of them at each site, we built something that was more a platform than a product that had a
lot of ability to be customized at each site. So when you do that, well, okay, you need to bring
someone to the site to understand what the users are doing and you know, build customization. And
historically, that's been understood as services, right? So that's something you want to minimize.
You don't want to be doing a lot of work per customer in this, you know, product-market fit mode.
And what Sham realized was that you can actually flip this around and make it valuable. So what he
realized we needed was for the FTEs to act as product discovery. So they would go to the site, they
would take the product as it was, and they would fill the gap between what the product did and what
the users needed. So you know, the FDE goes and builds like a gravel road to where the product needs
to go. And then the role of my team, of the product and engineering team, was to look at that and
basically figure out how that should generalize to the next five customers or the next ten customers
and then turn that, you know, gravel road into like a paved superhighway.

Host: I feel like "sales is product discovery" is a concept that's not new. It was certainly around
before Palantir, but typically the view used to be like you had your sales people that went out and
did the sales and talked to the customers and they came back and reported to the engineers. But it
seems like at Palantir, it was like the engineers were doing that work. Was that like a conscious
decision or how did that come about? Especially when you're selling into, like, the government and
defense, like you would imagine the natural inclination is to go hire some, like, experienced
salesperson who's got a history of selling into the government, some like Don Draper type, who wears
a suit and worked in the DoD for twenty years and takes generals out to steak dinners and things
like that. And that's actually not what you guys did, right?

Bob McGrew: Well, I mean, there's two angles. This one is we talked to a lot of those people early
on and they said, "Why the hell would I work with a Silicon Valley company when I could work with,
you know, a big five defense prime?" And then even when we talked to people who seemed like they
might be successful in this role, it was just very clear to us that they wouldn't mesh with our
culture and they wouldn't actually be successful. And when we tried doing something like this, it
almost never worked. And so what we found was very different. And I think the difference between
sales-led product discovery and FDE product discovery is that sales-led product discovery—you're
talking to people from the outside. And again, this is important very early on, but it's not as
effective as the FDE product discovery where you're solving these problems from the inside. So, you
know, the scope of a traditional implementation might be you start with something that's pretty
close to what the product does, but you want to be solving one of the key problems that leadership
has identified. If you're not solving one of the top five priorities for the CEO, it's probably not
going to work. They probably won't have the energy to persist through the much more challenging
route of getting effectively a new piece of the product built in a way that worked for them. Then
once you've solved that first problem, then the FTEs can identify other key problems in the
enterprise—sometimes much more valuable problems than the ones that you were first targeting—that
maybe it's not obvious that Palantir could have solved those problems or that your company could
solve those problems. But once you're there, you can see through product insight that you can
actually do this. And then you go and solve those problems. And so it switches from, you know, how
do I sell the same thing to each customer to how do I land and expand?

Host: Bob, can you lay out sort of exactly how the FDE model works at Palantir? Like if you were
giving people almost like an instruction manual, like, "Here's how we did it."

Bob McGrew: Yeah. So I think a starting point is to think about how the team was structured. And of
course, there's many different iterations, but I think this is the key thing that remains constant:
the two key roles are those of what we call the Echo team and the Delta team. The Echo team were
embedded analysts. So they would go to the customer site, they would speak to the users, they would
try to figure out what demo or what use case really made sense for the users at this site, what was
the key problem that could be solved. And they would also be the account managers. So they would
also be the people managing the relationships at the customer site. And the Delta team, the deployed
engineers, were effectively software engineers, typically very good at writing code, extremely
quickly, eating a lot of pain, as we put it.

Host: And they would be the ones who sort of took those ideas and brought them into the real world
and built a solution, a prototype, but something that could actually work, and then deploy that for
the customer. And all of this would come in a very short period of time. So, you know, you go in
with an idea for what you're going to work on. You set up, you know, for a few months in advance
that you're going to have a presentation with leadership to show them your progress. And then if
that presentation goes well, then you're going to actually deploy organization-wide. The interesting
thing about these two roles is they're very different kinds of people and profiles. How would you
even go about finding the right person to be in these roles? Because it's not just a regular
engineer that could fit FDE. They needed to have more of that talking to users, or the Echo team
also had to be more technical. It wasn't just an account manager. How did Palantir build this early
team?

Bob McGrew: Yeah. So the Echo team, you know, a classic profile for someone to join your Echo team
would be someone from the domain you're working in. So, you know, possibly a former Army officer or
someone who worked deeply in healthcare. So they have deep domain knowledge, but and this is really
important, they need to be rebels. Or Sham would probably call them heretics. They need to be
someone who understands how things are done right now and recognizes that it's insufficient, that it
doesn't work. Because if their perspective is, you know, they come from this world, it's great, then
they're never going to be able to figure out the step function change that the new software has to
be able to make. Because if you can't make some sort of, you know, three-x or ten-x change within
that organization, then, you know, there was no reason to go through all the effort of doing this.
You might as well have sold some sort of, like, very simple piece of software. So that's the key
profile for the Echo. And then for your Deltas, you want someone who's really good at prototyping.
So the wrong profile for a Delta would be someone who's a craftsman, who really loves, you know,
making sure the abstractions are exactly right, that, you know, they're building software that's
going to be maintainable for, you know, a dozen years, right? Because that's not the role. That's
not the job. And what you want is someone who can go in, you know, figure out, write some rough-and-
ready code. Sometimes that code is beautiful if you get the right person, right? But usually
not—that again, that's not the key portion of the job. But someone who can actually deliver that
outcome in the form of software on a timeline. And then it may be the case that the first version
they write has to be thrown away and maybe they write a complete second version, maybe someone else
writes a second version, depending on that person. But those are the key sets of skills.

Host: It does sound a lot like a founding team.

Bob McGrew: Yes.

Host: It sounds a lot like a founder.

Bob McGrew: Yeah.

Host: Would you hire former startup founders and turn them into these roles, or did it go mostly the
other way? I mean, I think it's no coincidence that Palantir has spun off like an incredible number
of startups because this FDE training, this is like exactly the training to become a startup
founder. You're learning all the startup founder skills, right? But did you go in the other
direction too?

Bob McGrew: You know, back in the day when we were getting this started, there was not a huge supply
of founders for us to pull from. I think, you know, maybe that's the opposite now, but I think
it's—I think you're actually quite right. What you're doing in each of these new environments, at
each of these customer sites, is a little bit like being a startup founder. But you're a startup
founder where you have access to some very powerful piece of product leverage that makes your job
easier. This is, I think, great training and, like you said, this is why you see so many startups
from Palantir.

Bob McGrew: founders. So the common knock that you hear on this from people who don't really know
what they're talking about is like, "Oh, it's just consulting dressed up with fancy marketing
speak." Why is that wrong? I think before I say I don't want to tell you glibly why that's wrong
because I think there's actually a real risk that it's right. Right. And I think, you know, if you
go back to 2015 and you talk to people about Palantir, maybe you would hear two things. One, that
Palantir is evil. Um, but the second thing you hear is that it's a consulting business that is never
going to scale, you know, that it's actually like a bad business. It's not a software business. And
we spent a lot of time trying to understand whether that was a correct characterization or not.

From a business model perspective, one of the key things that you will see that you should see is
that it may be the case that when you go into you do a new deployment at a customer that you're
actually losing money early on. As the longer you're at the customer, first thing is your product
because of the product discovery gets better suited to what the customer does. And so you no longer
need a large team of people at the customer site figuring out what the customer is doing, you know,
paving, you know, writing that code. The second thing is that you should be earning the right, as
Sean would put it, to have access to more important problems at the customer site. And so you should
see basically that your cost per value of the outcome you're delivering is going down. And so your
profit margins start off negative but then ultimately become positive after some period of time,
maybe a year, maybe multiple years at the customer site. And if you look at it from that
perspective, you can see that you're actually delivering, you know, real repeatable value.

Host: I guess one fascinating piece to make this work and drive the cost down is really the product
team.

Bob McGrew: Yes.

Host: So how does the product team fit in and work with the FDE team?

Bob McGrew: I think on the engineering side, uh, it actually, you know, it feels my job as an
engineer was actually not so bad because early on in the early days of Palantir, you know, we were
doing this founder-led discovery and we were building new products and later on at the later days of
Palantir, we were still doing that, we were still building new products. This felt great, right? Um,
but the roles that were really different are the FD team but then also the product management team.
And so the product that you're building instead of being highly verticalized and, you know, this is
one flow that millions of people are going to be going through, like if you're building Airbnb,
right? Instead, the role of the product team is really to hold the product vision. And so you have
to think, when I see this new problem that we're seeing at a customer site, what is the
generalizable version of this that applies to the next ten customers? Because if you, you know,
there's a classic failure mode here where the FD implements something for one customer and you say,
"Great, well, that's how you should do it," and you bring it directly into the product. And it turns
out, if you do that, you're building something that's over-specialized for one customer. And so the
part of the magic here is being able to build with the kind of product people. They can look at that
and sort of guess the correct problem that you're solving, which is always a little bit more general
than the problem that the customer is coming in with.

Host: So there was some wisdom to figure out which bucket it fit. Is this just for this vertical or
could it be generalized? So could you give us like an example of what that looked like in terms of
the products and verticals and what fit in one bucket versus the other one?

Bob McGrew: Yeah, I mean, probably the sort of like most basic example here is the invention of the
Palantir ontology itself. And so when we first started talking about working with, you know, the US
government and specifically with intelligence, you know, should we have a database table for people
and a different database table for money and a different database table for this? And this is super
obvious, I think, at this point. If you go down that route and you try to deploy to multiple people,
your database doesn't make any sense. And so the change here was say, "Well, we need to pull this up
to a higher level of generalization. And instead of thinking about specific types of objects, um, we
should allow that to be defined per customer by the forward-deployed engineering team." And so
that's the sort of origin story of where Palantir famously got its ontology.

Host: So how does that work today? Is there like a base database schema that has common reusable
objects like people and money that then gets customized per site?

Bob McGrew: Well, just, I mean, the database scheme is extremely general. There's just this notion
of objects, properties, media, and links between objects. And in here, I'm talking about Palantir's
government product, um, which was our first product. But the ontology is what encodes all of the
specialized information that's per customer. And you know, that says, "Oh, well, this is, you know,
a person, this is a ship, this is a money flow." And again, this is, I think, really the very most
basic example. But you know, if you build something for just one customer, then you're going to be
thinking in, you know, the description that applies to that customer. But instead of saying, "Okay,
well, for people we do this," you want to be able to pull it up a level and say, "Okay, well,
there's this common operation that we want to apply to things that have this property." Like people
have this property, but maybe also ships have this property, but let's be honest, money payments do
not have this property. And so you have to think at a higher level of abstraction.

We didn't hire product managers for a long time. And when it did come time for me to hire product
managers, I would interview people who were amazing product managers at, you know, other companies.
And I would ask them to think at this level of abstraction. And they were very—they couldn't really
think at this level of abstraction. They would say, "Okay, well, this is the flow. This is what it
should look like for this customer." But that was the wrong thing to do here. And they needed to pop
up a level and think at the level of like, "How does this work in the context of the ontology? How
do we change the ontology so that this specialized thing works across customers?" And of course,
there's many other examples that don't have anything to do with the ontology.

Host: Does that create any sort of cultural tension at Palantir itself? It sounds like you're
describing the FDEs as sort of these heretics. They like don't want to generalize. They want to do
what's best for the customer and build specialized solutions. But presumably for your own internal
product team, you do actually want to hire the people who can think at some level of abstraction and
want to build maintainable code that lasts for a while. Surely that must have created tension
somewhere where there's an FDE who's like, "No, I don't want to use the generalizable ontology. I
want to kind of do it this way."

Bob McGrew: Well, I mean, absolutely, there was a lot of tension. And I would not frame this so much
in terms of the skills that different people had because it was also very, you know, I think it's a
lot about the environment and what people do in the environment they're placed in. It was also very
common for FDEs to work in the field for a long time and then say, "Hey, I can really fix these
products," and then come in and do an amazing job, you know, on the product side and think at that
level of abstraction. But when you're at the customer site, you were faced with one very particular
problem.

Host: So the incentives are different versus the skills are different.

Bob McGrew: The incentives are different. And so you're solving one very particular problem and it
makes a lot of sense to just take the simplest approach to solve that problem. Um, and that is in
fact what the FDE should do. That's what the gravel road looks like. And then the paved road though,
you know, has to go by not just this one customer, but like a bunch of other customers that are
further down the road. So the paved road often looks a little bit different. But the flip side of
this though is, you know, imagine you said, "Well, clearly this FDE approach is just wrong. The FDE
is building the wrong thing. What if the product team just thinks really hard about what to build
and then they go build that?" They're absolutely going to build the wrong thing.

In fact, the way that we would often build features early on is that the FDE team would build
something, they'd see something at one customer, we'd bring it back to the product team in Palo Alto
and we would say, "Okay, what's the right generalized version?" And those FDEs would participate in
those discussions, right?

Host: That was incredibly important.

Bob McGrew: And then we'd identify several other customers. "Well, if it worked for this customer,
we think it could work for this other customer. So let's bring the FDEs from those customers in as
well and help them design. And they can help us design this feature so that when we build something,
we know it'll work for the customer it was initially prototyped, and we know it will work for these
others. And then, of course, once you've built that context where everybody can say, "Here are three
different workflows that are subtly different," then suddenly you're not having this argument about
like, "Well, we think it should be general and we think it should be specific," but everybody is
solving the same problem. And then I think that really melds the incentives.

Host: Do you feel like it requires a lot of organizational discipline to keep this model from
devolving into pure consulting where the FTE teams are just off building like whatever product the
customer needs?

Bob McGrew: Yes, you absolutely have to focus on this. Um, and I think one of the other failures—by
the way, it's even prior to that and more the easier failure to become a consulting firm. It's where
you build the product in the field that the customers are asking for.

Host: Rather than the one that's actually valuable to them.

Bob McGrew: Because it's often the case that the customer, right—you don't actually—customer is like
a whole organization. You don't talk to the customer. You talk to maybe the CIO, right? Or you talk
to one sponsor, usually a couple levels down from the CEO, who you only get to see every once in a
while. And it's often the case that they would rather just have you solve some problem that's easy
for them to have you solve rather than one that's really impactful and improves the business.

Host: Going back to the opening from Jared, what's going on with all these AI companies really now
ramping up and hiring tons of FDEs? What has caused them to really adopt this model, which was not
the case for the previous generation of companies with SaaS? What happened? Especially because I
feel like even as Palantir became successful and the FDE model became more known, it was still seen
as, "Well, you know, that's a one-off thing because Palantir is a unique company and selling to the
government. Yeah, like a really weird thing."

Bob McGrew: Yeah, but "Don't try this at home" mindset, right? Like, now everyone's sort of—it's
become, like Diana said, it's become very commonplace. Has that one surprised you? And then two,
like, why do you think that's happened?

This was absolutely a surprise to me. My first, second, and third pieces of advice to people who are
thinking about trying an FDE strategy is like, "Don't, don't do this at home. If you can avoid it,
like, it's probably bad for you. You're probably going to end up doing services, and then only if
you really try hard not to do it and fail, then well, then maybe actually it's a moat for you if
it's the only thing that can possibly work in your market."

So what's special about this market, right? Why does the AI agents market work this way? Maybe the
starting place is: why did Palantir have to adopt this? The Palantir market is not one coherent
market, right? So we were working with national intelligence agencies, with national law
enforcement, with the military. All of these organizations had some similar projects, right? But
even, you know, the difference between a counterproliferation workflow and a counterterrorism
workflow—one, you're trying to figure out who's building bombs, and the other one, well, who's
building nuclear bombs and who's building IEDs—and those are actually quite different in terms of
how they work. And so there's this incredible heterogeneity in the market. You should really think
of the market as different segments. Inside each segment, you can build something, and, you know,
the crossing chasm story a little bit applies. So you're starting off, you know, nothing seems to
work. Suddenly you find product-market fit in the segment. You know, you can deploy the people that
are doing this kind of workflow, and then, you know, at the next customer, you find the same people
doing a similar workflow and you can deploy with very little customization. But then there's a
natural limit to that. And so now you want to go tackle a different market segment, and you have to
develop a new piece of technology. And then that can be referenced in other market segments. Like
I'm sort of saying here, a segment is not the same as a customer, necessarily. Um, especially in an
enterprise or a very large enterprise like the government, where a customer is, you know, tens of
thousands of users potentially. In that case, that's where, you know, the FDE strategy matters
because you're doing, you know, it's like you're doing things that don't scale, but you're doing it
scalably over and over again for every market segment that you enter.

Why do we see this with AI agents? I think the other thing that's unique about Palantir is that we
were building a completely new type of product. The product that the users saw—well, you know, they
were used to basically tracking, doing their analysis and tracking people in a tool that looked like
PowerPoint. And they would collaborate by sending these files back and forth with each other. But
the product we built basically said, "Hey, when you're drawing out that link diagram, you're not
just editing a file. You're actually changing a database and everybody has the same database." And
so while to the user it looked like a small change on top of the work they were doing, to the
enterprise, to the organization we were selling to, it was a completely different market category.

And that, I think, is what's happening with AI agents. Where, you know, this is a completely new
market category. If you are implementing, you know, a standard SaaS product and you're replacing one
way of paying bills with a different way of paying bills, everybody understands what that market is.
And so, you know, there's not all this little segmentation. There's not the same kind of product
discovery. You can then, you know, make a product that's better than the incumbent product and scale
by replacing that product. With AI agents, there is no incumbent product. And so, um, also I would
say what it is to build AI agents is actually probably a lot of different things, and we don't know
what those are yet. We've got to figure them out. Probably in five years we'll look back and be
like, "Well, AI agents, it wasn't even a thing at all, right? We were actually doing all these
different things." And so that, I think, is why you're seeing the FDE model taking off because
there's so much product discovery to do, and you can only do it from inside the enterprise.

Host: Okay. How does this relate

Host: to um some of the classic YC advice which is do things that don't scale?

Bob McGrew: Well, that's the advice that you give to an early stage founder and the FDE model
effectively is doing things that don't scale at scale.

Host: Since you see a lot of people trying to apply the FDE model now to their new startups,
including a lot of people who didn't work at Palantir and are sort of doing it like second or third
hand, what are ways you see people getting it wrong or misconceptions that you'd like to dispel?

Bob McGrew: Maybe I will start by saying as I've advised a few different startups who are doing
this. I think the startups the most successful startups doing the FDE model have people from
Palantir running the FDE model. The startups that are that I've talked to who are switching to the
FDE model gained a lot of benefit by bringing on someone from Palantir in, you know, one of the core
roles. As I said, the engineering team is often fairly similar, you know, but maybe, you know,
continues to be fun for a long time. But the actual mechanics of how the FDEs work, how you build
these accounts, how you find the outcomes, those are those are actually quite different from a
standard software uh firm. And so one of the the key differences uh and and something that I think
is actually quite difficult for people to understand is uh how you choose a problem and then how you
price that problem. And fundamentally what you're selling with the FDE model is that you're not
selling the installation of software. You're selling an outcome. As Sean would say, you're selling
that you have solved a problem. The next question then is if you've now solved a problem that is
valuing, you know, delivering some value to the users, how do you price that? That's a very common
question we get from all these AI startups because

Host: in the age of SaaS you would do it based on usage or subscription or seats

Bob McGrew: and this is completely different is outcomes. How do you even price it? How should all
these AI founders price their solution?

Host: Yeah. And I think one of the the the really important things that is differentiated between
the FDE model and your sort of standard SaaS model is that with the FDE model with a SaaS model and
you know product market fit you're going towards you know very simple repeatable contracts very
simple repeatable pricing that makes sense across all of your customers and you know often you're
you're going to be quite comfortable with small contracts because the cost the marginal cost to
deploy is very low with the FDE model you're going to get pushed towards larger and larger
contracts. Um, like we talked about, you're going to be growing contracts per customer over time.
The contracts because they're complex are going to be more flexible.

Bob McGrew: I think this is what the AI startups that we work with discover on their own. I have
this company called Castle that does uh AI voice agent for mortgage servicing. So they work with
very large banks and the way they actually been able to go live with large banks is exactly that
model of ramping up is the number of successful calls that were handling all these mortgage
requests. Then they had like stipulations when it goes to scale it would be this much and that and
they kind of figured out on their own and other startups as well uh like Happy Robot is another YC
company as well doing AI voice agents for logistics. They're working with large companies like DHL
similar thing. There's an asymmetry here between you, the startup, and the business that you're
selling to, which is typically when you're selling to a large enterprise, they don't believe they
can actually accomplish anything. And that's because often times they've had many large projects
that have failed. They also don't believe you can accomplish anything, right? Because they think
that you, the startup, are just like them. You, on the other hand, know that you can actually
execute, right? And if you can't, well, you should go into a different line of business anyway,
right? And so early on it makes sense for the startup to just take on all the risk and say we're
going to just believe in our own execution and you know we're going to take on the risk and you pay
us if it works or you pay us when you know we're actually able to expand. The one place this can go
wrong is that particularly if you're doing a something that needs to be deployed into the enterprise
uh you know on premise

Host: uh or any piece of it needs to be on premise rather than in the cloud you do have to fight the
IT team.

Bob McGrew: Yeah, actually seeing that too.

Host: Yeah,

Bob McGrew: with some of these companies

Host: and more generally who needs to say yes inside the organization you're deploying into in order
for you to succeed because those people do not think like startups. they are not aligned with the
end user. And so you're going to have to figure out a way past them. And you know, this is part of
why it matters that you're working on one of the CEO's top five problems because you need to be able
to bring in someone from the top to say, "Yes, give them authority to operate. Give them, you know,
the ability to use, yes, you use this particular type of database. They need to use a different type
of database. they you know you have all these spec very specific organizational things that are
meant to apply to your IT staff who are building things in house but they don't apply to the startup
let them do what they need to do

Bob McGrew: how do Palantir get that executive buy in I think this is sort of what happening with
all these AI startups that taking off and going from zero to seven eight figures in revenue within a
year they figure out the executive buyin but it's all very haphazard I would say from all the
stories I know of.

Host: That's how it felt early on, too.

Bob McGrew: Okay.

Host: Right. Um, it's a discipline. It's a skill. You know, you need really amazing leadership on
the FDE team to be able to have that kind of discipline and, you know, to share what works, you
know, and just get the practice of doing it at one customer. I mean, I think it's not surpris.
That's that's why, you know, the c the companies I've seen that have done this the best have sort of
pulled that from people who've done it before. Um, but it can be learned. We learned it.

Bob McGrew: Jared point out earlier that the I think this the Palantir forward deployed engineer
model is not that different to sort of like classic YC advice around doing things that don't scale.
Um, we have this concept of like the Collison install, which is essentially we boil it down to don't
wait for people to turn up to your website, like go to them and get them to like install the
software

Host: and like physically go to them, like go to their office and like sit next to them.

Bob McGrew: And I feel like um it's always been a great starting strategy, but most startups aren't
getting big contracts off the bat. So actually the the reason they have to stop doing sort of like
this sort of manual high touch process is you just can't get the growth rates to sustain without at
some point having a product that scales. And it's kind of like what we were talking about earlier
like at some point you hopefully you build a product that's so good that people can figure it out
themselves and then all of your problems are just scaling it. With AI what's different is because
these contracts are so big now you can actually go quite far by doing like the high touch thing. And
maybe something you could help us out with actually is like probably a common office hour question I
get is like how far can I keep pushing this? And my advice is largely like well like it's okay to be
doing custom work per customer. You just want to get less custom per every customer. Maybe you could
give like more specific like higher resolution advice. It's like how do you know if it's okay to
like keep adding new customers in this sort of like high touch like I'm doing lots of custom work
way versus oh no actually I need to be like abstracting out um and building like an actual product
here.

Host: Yeah. And I and I think this this is actually really encapsulates the the key difference
between you know the the product market fit strategy and the FDE strategy. In the product market fit
strategy you want to be doing less work for every customer. You want to be driving down costs. You
want to keep the contract size the same. Yep. In the FDE strategy, you want to drive the contract
size up. So, you're doing more and more valuable work for this customer and also for future
customers. And because you're doing more valuable work, it's okay. You can leave the amount of
customization you do per customer the same.

Bob McGrew: So, the KPI or the internal metric is like contract size, not necessarily like how much
custom work they're doing per customer.

Host: There's two useful things here. So, one, the thing you can measure, yes, contract size. Um, I
would even be a little bit more general than that and say the value of the outcome you're delivering

Bob McGrew: because that's that's actually the true thing, you know, and do you yet have the muscle
in order to be able to monetize that and price that and capture that? Maybe not. But if you're able
to deliver more and more valuable outcomes to the customer, then you know you're you're doing
something right. The second piece that we haven't we didn't talk about yet is uh the value of the
product. And so the other thing you want to measure is are you getting more and more product
leverage against that outcome. This is all extremely counterintuitive when you're in it. It's very
hard if you're an FDE or if you're leading an FDE team. There's a lot of things you have to do that
that seem very counterintuitive. You have to, you know, build for the customer things they're not
asking for but that they actually want. On the product side, you often think to yourself, how do I
make a product that's just really easy for every customer to use? It's very easy. And and look, I I
I struggled with this myself quite a bit leading product early on like you want to focus on on the
user experience and you have to do that, but you also have to remember your other key customer is
the FDE. Your product should be, you know, ultimately delivering a good thing to the user after FDE
customization, but it should be delivering leverage to the FDE who's delivering that outcome at the
customer site. And that that amount of product leverage should be going up over time. like they
should be able to use your product to deliver more value to the customer without them having to go
and like pull in three more engineers in order to do it.

Host: That's right. If you know the first customer you deploy at takes a lot of work. If you want to
then go sell that same outcome to a different customer, then that should be a lot easier at the
second customer and it should get easier still as you go customer by customer. But then if you if
you really get it to work, remember that you're building a platform. So you're doing more than just,
you know, a stack of vertical use cases on top of each other. If you've correctly abstracted away
what the core concept is that you're really building, then you should also have an easier time. You
should have more product leverage even when you're not doing that use case, when you're doing
something that's sort of similar. Or you will find that your FDEs, if it's a really if it's really
good, you'll find your FDEs can figure out some new way to use that technique you built to solve
something completely different. There's almost like an internal market dynamic going on where like
if you've built it really well then the FDE should like choose to use it and you should see demand
from the FDE to use your sort of like abstracted product versus just like hacking a one-off solution
themselves.

Bob McGrew: Yes. Um although I will just note this is a very painful process for everyone involved.
Uh I probably can't use the word pain often enough uh in the FDE. You know there are many times
where I built something I thought it was amazing and I thought it was beautiful. Not not there yet,
right? But it would it really would help the FDEs as soon if they just had the the ability to see
it. And I'd be like, "Please use my product." They'd be like, "No, it's just this is way more work.
It's like not helpful." And I will say, uh, let's be honest, most of the time I was probably wrong
and I was building the wrong product for them. And, you know, I should see that. But sometimes also
I was on the right track, but you know, I I hadn't done enough to make it easy for the FDEs to use.
And so, you know, I would send, you know, the developers out into the field to deploy those early
solutions and get them over the line even to the point where the FDEs could use them profitably.

Host: Are the FDEs always right in that case or is like should the founders sometimes be just top
down and say like actually I just want you to do that do it this way.

Bob McGrew: I mean the the answer is like yes to all all of these things. The other thing that comes
up over and over again is just how much the right answer here is a matter of judgment. Um, and I
think I think going back to this question about product vision, right? Like what is the right
product that generalizes from, you know, this customer to the next three to the next 10, you you
very literally do not have the the information needed to answer that when you see that first
customer. And so it's just it it becomes a judgment call. So in the context of how all these FDE
companies price very differently based on outcome, how does that fit in with now the culture doing
demos? Because there's there's this thing in at least in SaaS or I used to get this push back from
my engineers demo driven product development. It would be sort of looked down upon but in this case
it's different for FDEs, right?

Host: One of the interesting things that happens there is because you have to go repeatably show
this to new customers, you're forced to give these new demos. But but actually I think demo driven
development works really well if you have the right kind of product. So you know in the early days
of Palantir we actually had one demo. It was a flow where you're you know stopping a terrorist plot
and we started this with you know just one of our features and every time we integrated a new
feature. We had to think to ourselves how do I show that this new feature is actually helpful for
the analyst who's going through this demo who's stopping this plot. You know when we integrated a
histogram we had to say well how do we actually use this how does that work with the existing
features that we already had and we went this you know we integrated a map and we had the same
question and if you think about the world from what am I building then you know you're thinking
about your capabilities you might think of each of these features individually and how to build the
best best version of these features but when you're building a demo you're thinking about it from
the customer's perspective and a really good demo is something where you show it to the customer and
you are creating desire in that customer for what you're doing. They have to see what you're doing
and just want to reach out and grab it and bring it into their life. And if you see that, then you
know that you've identified a real pain for the customer. And by doing that, that also forces you to
develop a better product because not only are you thinking, okay, do each of these features make
sense in isolation, but how do they work together? Um, if I'm going to be showing this demo over and
over again, even just simple things like moving from one feature to another, that part of the path
has to be very straightforward. And those

Bob McGrew: Are those all the kinds of product pain points that you would often see, but only later
after you've actually deployed to the customer. So what the demo does is it changes the locus of
what you're thinking about from thinking about what can I build to what is it that the customer
wants and am I solving that pain point for the customer.

Host: So it sounds like it's sort of this—you have to keep doing the gradient ascent in this very,
very highly dimensional, multi-dimensional space and you keep changing the variables.

Bob McGrew: Yeah. Yeah, I think—yeah, maybe that's a really key point here. The kind of company you
have to build is a learning company. And I think everybody wants to build a learning company, but if
you're a company like Google or Meta, it's very easy not to learn because what you're doing right
now was working. And if you just keep doing it, the market is growing, you know, everybody wants to
do what you're doing. You can just sort of keep coasting on the same strategy and it's paying off
for you. My advice to people, if they're thinking about where to join a company, is I tell them to
join a young company. Not necessarily a small company, right? But a young company, because a young
company is still figuring things out. It's still learning. It hasn't succeeded yet. You know, if
you're just out of college, you want a young company that is growing really fast, and then you'll
see what success looks like. That positions you exactly to be a founder of your own company later.
This is why Palantir has birthed so many other startups—is because even as a very large company, it
is still a company where everybody all the time is learning, focused on learning, and you know,
always doing that same grinding motion that it is to be a new startup. Because, you know, new
startups—a lot of pain there too, right? That is like probably the canonical part of the YC
experience is that it's not coasting. It's working really hard on something that you're not quite
sure if it's going to succeed. Obviously, Palantir's been a monster successful company. They're now
a super big company, huge organization. We heard that you're joining another large organization, the
US Army Reserve. Maybe you could tell us a bit about that, and are there any lessons from the
Palantir experience you're planning to apply there?

Bob McGrew: Yeah, absolutely. I've recently joined the US Army Reserve as part of Detachment 2011.
And so, you know, one thing just to get out of the way is to say that everything I'm talking about
here, these are my opinions. These are not the opinions of the US Army, the Defense Department, or
the US government. But I think it's been this absolutely intense experience, and it's a really
interesting story. So we are part of a unit that's advising the Army on technology, and we are not
just civilian advisers. We are actual officers.

Host: So you took the oath?

Bob McGrew: I'm a lieutenant colonel in the US Army.

Host: I heard you went through basic training too.

Bob McGrew: Yeah, we went through the direct commissioning course. We've been trained by military
academics, often at five in the morning, because that's the time that works for people on the East
Coast and doesn't conflict with our day jobs. We learn from officers. I had to take the Army fitness
test, which, since I am not very fit, you know, was something that I had to train for for nine
months. But it really matters because we're not just giving advice on the side. We have skin in the
game. We are actually part of the organization that we're advising. And the Army itself—the
leadership is very different from what it felt like in the early days of Palantir when we worked
with them back in 2005 or 2010. General Randy George, the Chief of Staff of the Army, Secretary of
the Army Driscoll—they have articulated a plan for the transformation of the Army. They know that
the Army needs to change from the kind of wars we fought in Iraq and Afghanistan to fighting the
kind of wars that are being fought today in Ukraine or what it would look like if we face large-
scale combat operations in the Pacific. They know the Army needs to move faster. They know the Army
needs to change. And we're a part of that strategy that they're executing. As they've brought us in,
they have given us the priorities for the Army. They've given us each an area in which we're
supposed to operate, but they've also given us the freedom to go around, look for problems, work
directly with the officers on the ground to solve those problems, or if need be, escalate that to
leadership and get that fixed. And so I think one of the things that's really interesting about it
is that in many ways it does feel a lot like running the FDE strategy on the Army. We get to see
what are the CEOs, what are the leadership's top five priorities? Can we make progress against
those? But also in a world where you see that there's a disconnect between what the leadership wants
and twenty years of how things have been implemented, and it takes a long time to change that. And
so we're helping them make that change. I'm really eager to have the opportunity to make a
difference.

Host: There's a question that we love to ask people on this podcast: What do you think are the best
opportunities for startup founders to work on right now?

Bob McGrew: Well, you know, I think this really goes back to exactly this question of why is it that
AI agents are pursuing the FDE strategy? And you know, if you zoom out and I put on my AI research
hat for once in this podcast, I think what we've seen is that capability improvements are extremely
fast. You know, yes, I heard people—after GPT-5, people feel like things are plateauing. But
actually, if you look at this time period between April 2024 when the best model—the release of
GPT-4o—and April 2025 and the release of o3, that's an extremely fast rate of progress. And I think
that's just going to continue. I think we're going to see capabilities continue to move quickly. But
what's really shocking actually is that the adoption is not anywhere near what you would expect from
the speed of these capabilities. What the world is going to look like over the next five years is
that the capabilities just race ahead and race ahead and race ahead, and somehow the world feels
increasingly banal. You know, you're in your Uber, and you're thinking, "Oh my God, it's autonomous
driving. No one's driving this." You're like, "Ugh, traffic is really slow."

Host: Yeah.

Bob McGrew: And so, you know, just like with the world of the FDEs, where you have the FTE filling
the gap between this product and what the customers need, I think this is a time where there's so
much availability to fill the gap between what the capabilities can actually do and what the
customers are able to adopt. And in the early days of AI, if we sat around a table in 2018 and
talked about what it looked like when AGI was built, people thought, "Oh, well, it's going to—maybe
over the weekend it's going to come alive and it's going to take over the world." And one of the
things that I think people missed in that was that AI needs to be adopted. It's something that
doesn't just happen by itself, but you need human ingenuity and exploration and, well, dealing with
a lot of pain in order to make that happen. And so I think there's just a huge amount of opportunity
out there—looking at what are the capabilities that are there, but what does it take to make them
really genuinely useful to people?

Host: There's an analogy that occurs to me. This might be a little bit forced, but it's almost like
OpenAI is the home product team and the startups are the FDEs out figuring out how to get adoption
of the research that OpenAI is cooking up back at the home office.

Bob McGrew: I think that's not a bad analogy at all. I think that is maybe the underlying truth of
what's making this whole FDE strategy exciting again.

Host: Okay, that's all we have time for here today. Bob, thanks so much for joining us. That was
really, really interesting, and we all learned a lot. We'll see you all here next time.
