## Transcript

Gary Tan (host): I think that's like the defining question. Like will you have control over your own
tools or will your tools have control over you? Using OpenClaw these days is like driving a Ferrari
and it's like exhilarating. It's insane. Like you get to do things like it figures things out you
would never think a machine could figure out and it does it so quickly, but then it's also like a
Ferrari and that you better be a mechanic. Like it's a Ferrari that will break down on the side of
the road, you know, when you most need it, and you need to get out with your wrench and pop the hood
and like fi fix it. You know, you're gonna have to fix it yourself. And so this is a very exciting
time in uh computer science and technology.

Welcome back to a special episode of the Light Cone. In this episode, we're going to talk about how
Gary Tan got back to building.

If you follow us on Twitter, you'll know that after a multi-year hiatus to become an investor, Gary
Tan is back to being a builder. And in the last couple months, he's shipped hundreds of thousands of
lines of code and built popular open source projects that have gone from nothing to more than a
hundred thousand stars on GitHub. And he did all of this while having a very demanding job running
YC full time. A lot of people on the internet don't even think that this is possible and are
somewhat like in disbelief, but It actually happened, we know because we were here to see the whole
thing. And so today we're going to talk about how he did it. Well, I'm relatively uh shocked myself.
So I I'm amazed as well. It was thirteen years of not coding, and then suddenly, boom, I'm doing
about four hundred X the amount of work that I was that year the last time I was even sort of like
two-thirds of the time writing code. Maybe to start things off, how about we go back to the project
that started it all off, which was Gary's list. Oh yeah. And just like talk about a few months ago
how you powered up Claude Code and like started to get back to coding. Yeah it was right after one
of the Lightcone episodes, right? Oh yeah, definitely. I realized that I wanted to bring together
all the people who believed what I believed, um, particularly for California. And so I started a Uh
501 C4 and now it's a C three and a PAC, which is sort of what a lot of political groups do. Um it's
a very common way to bring people together. You know, everyone focuses on the money, but we're
trying to bring together smart people. Um, you know, what I learned in the years of working in San
Francisco politics is that bringing together people is so powerful.

And uh that's what a mass social movement is. And I said, okay, well, why don't I just make a
website where we start doing that? And it would just start with um, why don't I start writing about
the issues that I'm worried about? It's like I want children in school, you know, people watching
this from all around the world might find it very, very strange, like I find it strange. that uh it
was not possible and still very, very hard for a seventh grader or eighth grader in middle school in
San Francisco public schools to be able to take algebra. And that was, you know, a math education
thing. Like I, you know, if I didn't get to do that when I was in public schools in the East Bay of
the Bay Area, there's no way I would have studied engineering at Stanford. I never would have
written code. I never would have been able to do any of these things. So it was close to my heart
and I realized like, Hey, it's time to write code and I ended up building Posterous, my first YC
startup from two thousand eight. What what was Posterous for people who don't remember it?

Yeah, Posterous was uh Dead Simple blogs by email. It grew to be a top two hundred website on the
internet and then Twitter ended up buying it for about twenty million dollars. So that was sort of
like my first bag really. I actually built it again uh as post haven when Twitter um you know bought
it for the amazing people that we had hired and uh they shut down the startup. It would have cost a
couple million dollars to buy it back from Twitter. And at the time I had no money in the world. So
the next best thing was why don't I write it again? And then uh in January of this year, I ended up
writing it a third time. Um only, you know, the first time it took about, you know, four million
dollars and, you know, six or seven people and about a year and a half. And then the second time it,
you know, took about, I don't know, a hundred grand and two people, me and my co-founder Brett
Gibson, who now runs initialized, um, and maybe like three months or so And then in this case it
took about $200, which was my Claude Code Max account, and probably five days. Full featured blog
platform, does everything you want. And then on top of that, like full rag, full um agentic
retrieval, like be able to you know, sort of go out and read all of the internet, like every tweet
I've ever done, recursive crawl, deep research of any topic. The algebra thing is just one of a
whole lot of different issues that we really, really care about. And to be able to go ingest the
internet, you know, see all the arguments for and against, and then to craft incredibly detailed um
reports on the back end about Um, what are all the quotables? Like I think people who are big
followers of the light cone might remember one of our first episodes about agentic uh systems with
Jake Heller, actually. So Jake created case text and he described exactly what I ended up building
for basically journalistic uh long form articles about any, you know, sort of issue or uh you know
piece of news that was happening. And so, you know, anyone can go to Gary's list.org today and You
know, we do about two or three relatively, you know, researched, all fully sourced um articles about
what's going on in California and San Francisco and LA and like how do we build a better government?
This is the thing I feel like people missed about Gary's little don't fully get is that it's like
the classic thing we've been talking about here, which is like Software was you build software to
let people use it. So it was like you build a blogging platform and people like write blogs and
maybe like they'd start their own sub stacks eventually or they like write articles. But Gary's list
is both blogging platform, but it actually does the work of a high-quality investigative journalist.
It's not just something that a journalist uses to publish their articles. Yeah. I mean basically the
for the equivalent of like five or ten dollars of Opus calls. I mean, I would estimate that it does
the work of like

Gary Tan (host): you know, a real human being that would have to like go painstaking through dozens
of articles, read entire books about certain subjects, uh, annotate them. I mean, going back to the
case text example, like the thing that Jake taught me was that you need to think about what a human
would do with the context given. Like what would it retrieve? Like, does it go to the library? What
kind of book would it look for? What does it search on for search, you know, on the web? I mean, the
great thing now is like You don't have to just do that. Like you can get Perplexities API and you
can do deep research there. You have X's API, you can do deep research there. You know, Grok's API,
if you need to like do research on X using the Grok API, is actually very, very good. And you can
just grab all of the context. This is sort of going back to the philosophy of uh boil the ocean,
which is one of my essays. It's like particularly when building agentix software now. You don't have
to settle for um what we did when we were humans writing the code. Like, and that goes for research
as well. What if you absolutely boil the ocean? Like, what is you know the total completionist?
Like, if you were a human, this would take you about a month to do this research. You can just, you
know, zap the rocks harder. Uh, you know, it you pay more money and you might be token maxing. but
you should token max. Like basically if there is incremental work that makes something more
complete, more awesome, more you know, in the case of um this type of writing, like we want it to be
more representative of reality. Like you know, we don't just settle for one source when we can get
twenty sources and we can cross reference them. We can figure out like, well, these thirteen sources
say this and the seven sources disagree with that and then, you know, you want to feed all of that
context into like your core prompt and then you can basically make a better decision than what you
would like just, you know, a human being clicking on a link, reading a headline, and that's all you
understand. And I think if you token max, like that's actually the coolest thing you can do now. And
it's not just in, you know, generating articles. It's not, you know, it's clearly in uh writing
code, right? I think now it's it's going to permeate every part of society, like every thing that we
would call knowledge work could be token maxed. And um I don't think that it means that we're gonna
get rid of people. I think it means that people need to s still supply uh the agency. Like I need
this. Like I'm the one who's sitting here caring about algebra. Like I want kids like me who
couldn't afford private school. You know, San Francisco is the one city in the world that has the
highest rate of private school attendance, um, probably in the entire country, actually. And that's
not okay. Like you shouldn't have to be rich to have a good education. And, you know, I don't know
why that's controversial. And so for me it's like this, you know, mass sort of shift in technology
was happening. And then uh I had a need and a want and a desire and it was a burning desire. Like I
it hurts me and pains me to think about ten, twelve, thirteen year old kids who don't know algebra
and like could have But uh some bureaucrat or, you know, some virtue signaling person in power says,
like, actually I don't want that kid who wants to learn algebra to learn it. So I think in this
process of basically solving your own pain and need from the young Gary and building Gary's list,
you sort of discover a lot of patterns on token maxing and this new way of building that led you to
the next project, which was uh G Stack. Like I actually did not plan to make G Stack. All I did was
like I uh realized that I was doing the same things over and over again. And then I got sick of
typing the same thing. So I went into my Apple notes. I typed in all the things that I found myself
writing over and over again into Cloud Code. And it was pretty simple stuff. It's like here's the
plan review. One of the things I started doing is I really love asking Claude to make ASCII art
diagrams. One of the things I discovered is um sometimes Claude would just get confused and like
write bugs or not be complete. But once I started saying, actually before you start your work, make
an ASCII diagram of all the data flows, all the inputs and outputs, what are the user flows, what
are the error messages? And you can see this. It's like data flow, state machines, dependency
graphs, processing pipelines, decision trees. Once it did that, it loaded all of the context in and
then it just did the work more completely. Like it boiled the ocean better. And it broke down into a
bunch of different sections. Like here's architecture review, code quality, test. I mean, one of the
things I learned building Gary's list was that when I was writing the code myself, I would always do
the minimum amount of testing. 'Cause it's just like not very fun. I knew I needed to have it, but
I'm here to write, you know, fun new code. I, you know, did not like write to write tests. And then
honestly, like I hit all the things that everyone else hits when they start vibecoding, which is
like, this is slop, it's not working that well. Like it works fine for the 80% case, but If any
users actually touch it, it starts falling over. And then that's when I realized, oh, I can get to a
hundred percent test coverage. I've since learned that a hundred percent is probably too much. Like
hitting eighty to ninety percent is usually the best practice at this point. Um, but yeah, this this
is basically the first version of plan dash eng dash review. I know uh everyone knows the office
hour skill, uh, which is you know what people can use and I still use when I'm trying to make a
brand new product or a brand new feature. It uh simulates what uh what we do when we're working with
a company. It's like, how do you know that people want this? You know, who's it for? What does it
do? And what's the impact, right? But this is like the proto skill. Like this is, I didn't even know
skills existed. And I posted this and it went viral. Like, you know, 200,000 people saw that. And
then I made another version of it that was a mu much more ex uh expansive version. I called it the
mega plan. And then I ended up um renaming it to the CEO plan. We've probably talked about meta
prompting before. I used meta prompting here. I took the other review plan that we had and then uh I
said, Okay, well let's do a version of this, but like imagine Brian Chesky sitting with you, right?
Like Brian Chesky has this great line about

Gary Tan (host): uh what is a ten star experience? So and you know the point of it is everyone
thinks about hotels in terms of like three this is a two three-star experience, this is a four-star
experience. And he like goes, you know, through the list, like five stars. It's like everyone, you
know, yeah, cool. Like he's like, what's a six star? And what's a seven star? And what's an eight
star? And like he goes all through that entire list.

And um that's one of my favorite like product and design exercises to go through like as a mental
exercise. And then the cool thing is like you can do that every single time now. And so that's what
this is. You know, this prompt basically tries to figure out what is the platonic ideal of uh what
this is. These are sort of like the three, the two things that are pretty awesome. One is uh what is
the 10x check? What is more ambitious and delivers 10x more value.

uh for only 2x the effort. Right. And so for whatever reason, coming out of latent spaces helps the
model like really visualize. Like so I'm Plan CEO skill I actually really enjoy because I'm an ADHD
C A CEO and I love um potential, like pure potential. And so this is like the one like I can't
believe this is just literally two little sentences, but like this unlocks an incredible amount. And
so that's how G s G Stack started actually not as

You know, I didn't want it to be anything other than like, well, I just need to make some skills and
I had heard that people were making like skill repos.

But then the third thing I did was I started um using these two skills so much that um my conductor
instance was getting very backed up. So this is how I use conductor. Uh this is actually my real
setup. Like Okay, so this is your like daily workflow. This is how you've been shipping hundreds of
thousands of lines of code a month. It's all it's all in here. Yeah, that's right. So I dropped like
13 PRs in the last 48 hours, and then you know, I you just queue them up. Like anytime I come up
with a new idea.

I come in and uh here it is. You know, I loved using the CEO skill. I loved using the eng skill to
like really make it super well tested. I did that all in plan mode. Uh, and then I'd click approve
here, and then you know, Claude would go and do all the stuff. And then I did that so much that I
ended up having like 15 different features that were all queued up waiting for me to manually test
it.

Like it passed it all, you know, it passed end-to-end testing, it passed uh integration, it passed
unit tests, but like at the end of the day, I still need to, you know, for Gary's list, it's like
pop open the Rails server and like, you know, load that user and like make it into that
configuration for that particular user and like manually just make sure it works.

And I got sick of doing that and I was trying to use um Claude encode MCP and it was very, very
slow. Two to three seconds for every turn. And it was like this is not usable for QA. But I had
heard that Microsoft had released Playwright, which is sort of um an alternative testing framework.
In retrospect, it's like actually there was like

Agent uh they're like agent harness and like all these other like tools that I could have used. But
the upside and downside of Claude Code is it's so easy to just start something that I just popped
open, like I literally went in here and this is probably what I did. It's like I'm so sick of using
Claude. Claude in in Chrome MCP, it's too slow. Let's go ahead and wrap Microsoft's playwright.

Can we do that? And then I just press enter. And then, you know, one of the things that emerged with
G Stack is that like this is how I create new features now. Of course, what you know, what it's
gonna do now is like, hey dude, you already did that, which is hilarious. You know, I have bug fixes
right next to giant features. And then um the way G Stack works, there's a CEO, there's a designer,
there's actually a developer experience person in there. There's a number of design tools.

Uh and then plange is the last one. And then I actually usually run slash codex. And um I recently
added a slash claude in codex. So one of the cool things that I actually learned from uh YC alums, I
came to an event and brain totally frazzled, but you know, went to one of our batch events and we
were just you know shooting the shit about what's going on with Claude Code versus Codex. And at the
time I was a total Claude Code only guy.

And uh I realized, oh, a lot of people actually prefer codecs. Why is that? And I discovered that
Claude Code is ideal for the ADHD CEO. But once in a while there's a you know, Claude Code will just
BS a bunch of stuff. Like claude models are very, very good, but like they are not the smartest, it
turns out. And so a lot of people r you know explained to me that if you have a problem that's much
crazier, you need the two hundred IQ nearly nonverbal CTO.

So you can just call in a friend and then that's what like slash codex is. It's a you know G stack
skill that takes whatever plan it your your plan is or if you're out of plan mode and you already
implemented, it'll take your repo and it'll run codex in a command line prompt with the prompt that
says find all the problems and all the bugs and it reports it back to Claude Code and then you and
Claude Code can work through those feet that feedback.

Uh and then I have since added if you use Codex as your main coding agent, you can actually go and
type slash Claude and have Claude come and be the CEO briefly if you want as well. The cool thing
about Gstack is when I run it through this program, like I always I do I start with office hours,
CEO review, like I do design if there's UI, if um I know a developer needs to use it, which is like
practically all of G Stack and Gbrain stuff, I run the developer review.

And then I do end review and then codex. Once that plan is done, I've worked through all of the
issues. The G stack relies very heavily on ask user question. So cause you know, and that's that to
me is like really important. That's where the human, you know, vibe coder, operator, agentic
engineer needs to supply their understanding of

What's going on? What are we building? There's not really a substitute to that. It would surprise me
very much if someone really truly did manage to make a thing that could just make software without
the human in the loop. Like that, you know, it's controversial take, I think. But um I never want to
be entirely out of the loop. I just want the machine to do the stuff that I don't want to do. And
so, you know, basically QA is a good example. And, you know, I mean, that's hilarious. Coming back
to the demo, it's like

I type something into the modern version of G stack and it's like, dude, what are you doing? Like,
we already built that. We have Browse. Browse is a long-lived HTTP daemon with 70 commands as a CLI.
And then QA is just browse. But um in the prompt for QA, it says, look in your context. What did we
do on this branch?

Gary Tan (host): If there's UI or any mutation of data, go and use the browser to test that thing.
Which is cool, is like having a black box browser. It blew my mind when it first worked. It's like
mini AGI is already here. You know, I you know, I realize this is not true AGI. True, true AGI would
be like, I'm not even here. Um and actually that's fine. In this respect, like as a builder, you
know, selfishly, uh, I hope that we never have to stop. I hope that the machines never figure it out
'cause that would be really cool. Like then, you know, humans are really important and like
engineers who know how to do this, who have taste in design and product feedback and um, you know,
the real customer in mind, like we're gonna be like we basically have wings for as long as we do.

Gary Tan (host): YC Startup School is back. We're hand selecting the most promising builders in the
world and flying them out to San Francisco for July twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth to discuss the
cutting edge of tech. Apply now for a spot. Okay, back to the video. I think you crystallize a lot
of these thinking in this post on X about thin harness and fat skills. Oh yes. Which actually
encompasses all of this philosophy on how to token max.

Gary Tan (host): Yeah. I mean, some of it came out of uh being trolled on the internet relentlessly
about markdown and like I you know, I'm just like peddling a markdown a set of markdown. And it's
like I you know, I guess my lived experience at this point is that markdown is actually code. It's
just like this compiled in a different way, but like you can get the computer to do really
astonishing things. Like I mean, even this, it's like Could we have imagined that I would be talking
to something that has replaced Visual Studio for like I I don't use Visual Studio at all. Like
there's no reason to, like when I can talk to my agent and my agent can do this, right? The article
actually name the name actually came from uh our partner Pete Kuban. We have had to build an
internal agent and uh, you know, we call that the harness over and over again. And then at some
point using Claude code all day, we realized like you know, why should we rewrite a version of that
over and over again? Like, you know, we should just use the things that are really awesome as, you
know, harnesses. Like a harness is the core loop that takes the user input, gives it to the LLM,
runs what the LLM does, like it can do tool calls and things like that. I mean, why would we build
that? Like what we should be spending all our time doing is thinking about What markdown should
there be? And the way to think about markdown is if you were an event planner and throwing a wedding
and you were trying to write down a checklist of how to throw a wedding again, like what would you
what would you write in plain English to teach the next person who had to do it what to do? All of
that should be in the markdown.

Gary Tan (host): Whereas um all the things that should, you know, be deterministic, like um I mean,
or is uh is a real action. Like a a wedding planner might have to call like twenty venues, right?
But you wouldn't use markdown for that. Like you would make a, you know, a call to Twilio, for
instance, right? There's like a l you know, sort of all of the difficulty in gentic engineering
today is when people try to do things that should be in markdown in code and it fails because code
is brittle. It doesn't understand special cases. It does actually, you know, code literally doesn't
understand what you want or who you are. It is like, you know, executing deterministic zeros and
ones in a Turing complete loop, right? Like it doesn't know. But then now we have LLMs that have
latent space and they know who you are. And uh it knows what your motivations are and it can handle
generic cases.

Gary Tan (host): And then, you know, a lot of the the magic right now as an engineer is like
figuring out, okay, how much of it is over here in LLM land and how how much of it is over there in
um code land. And then, you know, if you combine that with the other thing I learned, which is like
get the 80 to 90 percent tests. Like if it's not tested and you're just throwing users in there,
like it's slopped, you know, 10x worse than like human written code. 'Cause like you just have no
idea what's going to happen. Um, and so that's like one of the things that people have to do. It's
like, all right, not only do you need to figure out what's going on in latent space and
deterministic space, you also have to make sure that like it's, you know, unit individually tested
and then the integration is tested.

Gary Tan (host): And then going back to uh boil the ocean, like the machine doesn't care. It'll just
do it. It's amazing. Like just zap the rocks more and you can get to ninety percent test coverage.
And then you can have a system that, you know, is not quite perfect. Like, you know, open claw right
now, um, there are lots of like failure cases, but it's ninety-five percent there. You know, it's uh
I feel like using open claw these days is like driving a Ferrari and it's like exhilarating. It's
insane. Like you get to do things like it it figures things out you would never think a machine
could figure out and it does it so quickly. Uh but then it's also like a Ferrari in that you better
be a mechanic. Like it's a Ferrari that will break down on the side of the road when you most need
it and you need to get out with your wrench and pop the hood and like fix fix it. You know, you're
gonna have to fix it yourself. And so this is a very exciting time in uh computer science and
technology because it's like this is homebrew computer club, uh, you know, the moment when the Apple
One came out. Like the Apple One created by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak was a breadboard inside
like literally a wooden case hammered together with like nails and duct tape, you know? And uh if
you wanted a personal computer, that's what you had to do. And that's where we're at right now. Like
you have relatively, you know, smart technical and you know people who had to study computer science
have to spend like two or three hours and like maybe like five hundred or a thousand dollars in both
tokens and cloud. to actually get something like that running. But like once you get it, it's like
we're sort of in the kit car Ferrari phase. It's like then you can drive and you can go anywhere and
you know you want you want to shout to the hills like, hey I got a Ferrari. Even the part about
fixing yourself, I feel people um

Gary Tan (host): It's just like one of those things until you've like pushed through, you just don't
quite get. If I really zoom out, it's almost just like things have moved so quickly. Like if you
think way back, just having Stack Overflow as a website that you could consult when you got stuck on
a programming problem felt like amazing. And then it's like like Chat GBT launches, like, oh now
I've got this like interactive thing that's way better than Stack Overflow. But you're still sort of
doing the same thing. You're like asking questions and you're copying and pasting code and you're
running the code and seeing what happens and copy and pasting it back and then You sort of with
Claude code, you sort of push through and you realize oh you don't need to do the copy and pasting
anymore. It just like actually like executes and runs the code. And even with OpenClaw, I found that
when I set it up, yeah, it's annoying because it can like effectively brick itself and it does a
bunch of annoying things. But if you actually have like Claude code, like sort of fix it. Yeah, like
just have clawed code running, it will just like fix it. And uh it's clearly not the way things will
be long term, but there's this like mentality shift of it. It doesn't actually matter if it's
brittle and requires fixing because you can actually just have another agent like sat there. like
fixing it all the time. Yeah. I feel like this evolution I was like completely Claude code pilled uh
and still am, but like probably only like fifty percent or sixty percent of my time like building
product Um or agentic engineering is in Claude Code now. At some point, basically almost half of it
is through OpenClaw now. Yeah, which is very interesting. I mean, then again, I'm also spending a
lot most of my time working on G-Brain itself. So G Brain came about because I met, you know,
obviously we had Peter on the show. Um, and then I finally got around to it. It was like one weekend
I said, I gotta check this out. Like, what's going on with OpenClaw? Let's get it going. And um,
this was about the time Karpathy wrote his uh X post about knowledge LLM wikis. And so I was like,
okay, well, I have a repo full of markdown. All my you know, I should put all my context into that
markdown. And then at some point I realized, oh shoot, it's just using grep. And grep is not that
good. Like it's, you know, wasting context. Uh it's loading a lot more into context than it needs
to. And then I sort of fell into a rabbit hole. I just went into conductor, click quick start, and
then I had G stack built into conductor already. And, you know, basically this was how I started. I,
you know It was actually much more interesting than that. So uh I didn't start off from nothing. One
of the things I've learned as you write like a larger and larger corpus of code is like you have it
loaded in your brain. You're like Oh, well, in order to build an agentic newsroom for um Gary's
list, I actually had to learn about uh vector embedding and hybrid RRF and chunking. Like when
you're in there trying to make it work, you're just like very applied. It's like I have an output
that I want. I want the article to look like this, it needs to be of this quality, it needs to have
these citations, like you start building up uh your, you know, your tests and integration tests and
like you end up with like a product that's like battle tested from like the output that you want.
And so I sort of put two and two together and I s you know and this is something that you know
anyone can do actually. It's like this this is why I think we're entering the golden age of open
source. Uh I could just open you know this project in Cursor and then the first thing I write is
like, you know, go look at you know tilde slash git slash Gary's list. Like look at how we do
chunking, embedding, uh, you know, hybrid RRF, rag, like all of this, and then just like extract it.
And then I want to use Postgres with PG vector. And like I want a a you know, full rag system for my
open claw. And then sort of like one thing led to another. It's like then I have, you know, 10
windows and G Brain and I'm just like at it. What's cool about open claw? I mean, maybe this is a
good example. This is actually my open claw. I did go ahead and ask. It's um how you know, how did I
actually get into it? January twenty third. Also all your email I had a tweet that was like Claude
Code this week has awakened my twenty five year old self, the one that checked Red Bulls and stayed
up till dawn coding. We're so back. The builder identity resurfaces. You know, I'm basically back
to, you know, sleeping four hours and, you know, coding twenty hours a day. You know, this is also
when I started getting myself into trouble like talking about lines of code. I still believe this,
by the way. Yeah, this might be like a good quick aside to talk about. Like this this idea of like
lines of code being important measure has been like controversial on the internet. There's obviously
the counter argument like, oh, lines of code doesn't like measure developer broad productivity. But
Well, it doesn't, right? But it also does. So it also kind of does, right? Yeah. Like it does it's
clearly and you know what's interesting is you can actually um there's well published Git repos out
there that you can run to uh strip away and like standardize what is actual logical lines of code.
And so I actually did go ahead and do that. Um, you know, and I got into trouble for saying like,
oh, I'm coding at like a hundred X uh the rate that I was in twenty thirteen. And then after I did
the logical lines of code strip down. It actually went up. It actually went up. So it turns out that
I was actually doing 400X the amount of code. But you know, obviously I wasn't writing it. I was
directing you know, fifteen agents at a time to do so. And then by the numbers, like it was not that
it did like knock down my lines of code from Claude Code a little bit. But uh the surprising thing
to me was that it knocked down the amount of lines of code that I was writing in twenty thirteen by
like seventy percent. And so I think that that's sort of the mismatch here. Like people get very
upset because it's easy to like pad the lines of code if you're a human writing code. Whereas like
unless you direct Claude Code to literally like pad the lines of code, it doesn't necessarily do
that. Like it'll maybe build the wrong thing. Like you might not steer it very well. It might not do
the right thing. But like it's not trying to optimize for lines of code the way a human working a
job would, right? Which is, you know, that's just life. And then

Gary Tan (host): I guess the really surprising thing is if you look at the literature about software
engineering going back to like 2000, 1990, I mean, it's pretty clear that the average number of
lines of code that a professional software engineer that's like tested and production ready, it's
not like a hundred lines of code. It's like fifty. It's like thirty like a day. Yeah, a day. Right.
Like for me it was like fourteen, but I was like part-time. I don't know. It's uh so that's where
the four hundred X actually came from.

You know, the other thing I know is like I should have said that instead of just trolling people
more on the lines of code. So I you know, if I trolled you on the internet, I'm very sorry for that.
Like there, you know, there is a deeper understanding of this. And I did end up releasing a blog
post about it that um explains this quite a bit more. I mean, and I think it's not a little bit
significant, it's very significant for people who are technical.

Because it actually raises the bar on like what you are capable of doing. Like all the people who
are attacking me about lines of code, they particularly are the people who are most likely to get
wings if you like let it rip and token max. This is sort of like the classic problem. It's like if
you have taste and you understand technology, you are particularly the people who should would
benefit the most from getting this. All someone has to do is

you know, believe. Right. So stop fighting. Just the open cloud code and try it, you know? I think
another thing that's potentially going on is just like the experiences vary dramatically depending
on like the the models and the harnesses. Yeah. Um I certainly something I've noticed is any sort of
like

semi-complicated programming task I try and do through my open claw agent just like kind of fails.
Um like it's exactly the same model and sort of like Opus four point seven as Claude code, but it
just like

Like anything above like a simple script, I just find like it's not like that great at. So I'll go
back into like Claude code. And then it was sort of a moment for me where I realized, oh, like this
is how it used to feel. Like this is how like even six months ago it used to feel like, oh like you
try and like these things there. Yeah, these things aren't quite there yet. And then Claude code
with like Opus four point five was like, oh like it's actually like here. It's about to recur. Like
right now people sort of are feeling like OpenClaw or Hermes.

is like not quite there or it's like a lot of work and then I guarantee you like

this time next year, like everyone's gonna be saying what you heard here first, which is like every
single person on the planet will have their own personal AI. We could either live in a world where
we have our own AI, where we have our own data, our own integrations, like we see what's happening,
we write our own prompts and we have control over what we see, uh, or it's corporate controlled.
It's something, you know, you go to a host, it's kind of like your Facebook feed.

And like you don't know what that you know, who wrote that algorithm and who does it benefit and
like what business model is behind it? Like nobody knows. The most powerful idea that like was a
gift was the personal computer revolution. And we're about to go through exactly that same shift
with personal AI. And it's gonna be a choice. Like, you know, people are going to have to figure
out, am I willing to write my own prompts? And you know, I think I wish Pete Kuhn were here. Like
that's one of the things we learned from him too. It's like

unless you have your own prompts and you can write it for yourself, like you are, you know, below
the API line for some PM or developer that is not you, who like will not understand you, will not
understand your needs, will not understand what you uniquely care about. And I think that's like the
defining question. Like, will you have control over your own tools or will your tool your tools have
control over you?

And I think this is the one of the disconnects that the public has, I think, is a lot of uh these
capabilities you have to be on the latest and greatest models. And it's actually quite expensive to
use them and burn all the tokens for now. Yeah. It's coming down, but I think maybe people are just
trying like Sonnet or the free model or having the basic Claude Pro subscription only. Yeah.

And part of it's maybe we have to address that this new way of really getting all this

almost ASI AJI moment for for building is you have to be burning lots of tokens, the whole token
maxing paradigm. It actually reminds me of rent, San Francisco rent. Like one of the things that I
feel like we always have to do um with YC founders is that it's like a general thing. It's like, oh
like I don't want to move to San Francisco because it's like so expensive to live there. But it's
like It's so expensive to not live there. Exactly that's the whole point, right? Like early on in a
YC batch, like I'm just used to like a fan of being like

Like this like this apartment is like thousands of dollars a month in rent, like this seems
ridiculous. Like, should I like pay it or not? And it's like, no, you should absolutely pay it. And
if anything, you should pay more to not just be in San Francisco, but be in like the dog patch and
just like be in like neighborhoods where you create the serendipity. Like token maxing is going to
be one of those things for founders that we sort of have to teach them where it's not immediately
obvious that you shouldn't this is actually like rent. Like this is one of the things where you
should like spend as much as you can to like get the like

most utility out of it versus treating it like the d office desk or something. Like sure, you can
economize on that or you don't need like a super expensive like couch. But like when it comes to
like actually using the models and your token spend, you should probably be like pushing pretty hard
on that. Yeah. One of the key maxims for YC is, you know, how do you find good startup ideas, live
in the future, and build what's missing, right? And so this is a profound version of that where all
you have to do is commit your brain

to look at, you know, spending five hundred dollars in a single day on tokens and say, actually
like, you know, as long as I'm building something that's actually of great value to me, you know,
and I'm building the right thing.

Uh, I'm gonna do that. Gary, I have a weird question. Do you think that in some ways the fact that
you tried to build all of this while also being the CEO of Y Combinator actually helped you? Because
like your time is so scarce, you had to like try to figure out how to write hundreds of thousands of
lines of code with just like spare minutes in between meetings. Yeah. Unlike a prof a full time
software engineer.

Gary Tan (host): that could, you know, just take the time to like open the website and like click
around it, like just hit test it. Like those minutes were like insanely scarce for you. And so you
were constantly pushing yourself to figure out how to like automate everything. Yeah, I I envy time
billionaires. You know, sometimes look at I mean, I'm look at my kids and it's like, these kids are
time billionaires right now, man. Like, you know, you could just like do th you know, you know, we
run across people at startup school all the time and it's like You're a time billionaire right now.
Like this is incredible. Like you could just do anything. You like learn about anything. This is so
great. So yeah, I'm, you know, personally, like, I think my philosophy is I am in a crazy rush. In
my brain, I'm like probably live 10 billion lifetimes to live in this body right now, and I need
every single moment to count. Uh and then if you can token max, it's like, I mean, you could buy
millions of years of consciousness, of machine consciousness. Now I can be a time billionaire. It's
not, you know, my own time. It's the time of a machine like doing work for me and like the human
entities that I care about working on the causes that I care about, right? I care about Y C. I care
about builders being able to build. Even in a lot of our internal meetings last year, remember in
our offsites, we would talk about like how do we teach the next generation how to use these tools?
And so, you know, I'd like to s I wish that I could say like that was a all a part of the grand plan
and that's how it started. It's not like, but you know, subconsciously I actually think it was like
I think subconsciously from doing Lycone and like talking about this stuff, like sitting side by
side with uh Boris Cherny right here. was a very powerful moment for me because I realized like he's
he started saying things that like I could do myself. It's like he said, our team doesn't write a
single line of code. I'm like, oh, actually like I can do that. And like the people who are watching
right now, it's like you and I are not different, right? We're the same. Like we started in the same
place. I don't think of myself as like you know, in the sky yet, even though people seem to talk
like I am, you know, like I'm just a person trying to do a thing. And if I sit next to Boris, I'm
like, you know, this guy is one of the best engineers I've ever met. But also like If I just open a
prompt, we have the same prompt. We have the same MacBook Pro. And, you know, there's nothing that
stands between like me or you or any of us from like drawing on millions of years potentially of
like tokens to like serve humanity. Well, Gary, I think that was a beautiful quote. That should be
retweetable. It says you could have infinite time by borrowing the time from the machines. Yeah,
what a time to be alive. That's a beautiful thought to end on. Thanks, Gary, for showing us the
future. Thanks, guys. All right. Thanks for watching and we'll see you on the next episode of the
Light Code.
