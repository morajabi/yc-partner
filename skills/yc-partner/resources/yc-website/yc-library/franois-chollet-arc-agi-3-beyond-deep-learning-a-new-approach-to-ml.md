## Transcript

Garry Tan (host): Today we're lucky to be joined by François Chollet, founder of the ARC Prize, a
global competition to solve the ARC AGI benchmark. His latest project is NDIA, a lab exploring a new
paradigm in frontier AI research. François is one of the best people in the world to help us
understand the current AI moment and where all of this is going. François, thank you so much for
joining us today and congrats on the launch of ArcAGI V3.

François Chollet (guest): I think we're probably looking at AGI 2030. Around the time uh the two are
gonna be releasing like maybe ARC 6 or ARC 7, you're not gonna stop uh AI progress. I think I think
it's too late for that. And so the next question is okay, like AI progress is here. Uh it's actually
gonna keep accelerating. How do you make use of it? How do you leverage? How do you ride a wave?
That's the question to ask. Thanks so much for having me. I'm super excited to be here. Super
exciting time to talk about AI. So François, tell us a little bit about India. So what exactly is it
and what are you guys trying to achieve? Right. So India is this new AGI research lab and we are
trying some very different ideas. And so our goal is basically to build this new branch of machine
learning that will be much closer to optimal, unlike unlike deep learning.

Garry Tan (host): All of us right now are sort of taken by what's going on with code. Uh I have sort
of this viral moment right now where I got to forty thousand stars this morning on uh G stack. So
it's like, oh, this is an open source project that now is one of the biggest ones and I have more
than a hundred PRs from contributors to deal with. I guess you're, you know, one of the best people
to talk to about this because you're you're actually literally coming up with something that is a
totally different pathway.

François Chollet (guest): That's right. That's right. So uh what we're doing at India is uh we're
doing program synthesis research. And when I talk about program synthesis, often people ask me, oh,
so are you doing like code gen? Are you uh building an alternative to coding agents? And that's
actually not at all what we are doing. We are working at a much, much more uh much lower level than
that. Uh what we're actually doing is that we are trying to build a new branch. Of machine learning,
an alternative to deep learning itself, uh, rather than like coding agents. Coding agents are like
this very, very high-level last layer piece of the stack, and we're actually trying to rebuild the
whole stack on top of different foundations. So we're building a new learning substrate that's very
different from you know parametric learning, deep learning. So if you go back to uh the problem of
machine learning, you have some input data, some target data, and you're trying to find a function
that will map the inputs to the targets that will hopefully generalize to new inputs. And uh if
you're doing deep learning, what you're doing is that you have this parametric curve that serves as
your as your function, as your model, and you're trying to fit the parameters of the curve via
cradian descent. And this is basically what we're doing. uh except we are replacing the parametric
curve with a symbolic model that is meant to be as small as possible. It's like the simplest uh
possible uh model to explain the data, to model what's going on. Uh and of course if you're doing
that, you cannot apply gradient descent anymore. So we are building something that we call uh
symbolic descent, which is like the symbolic space equivalent of gradient descent. The idea is to
build this new machine learning engine. That's giving you uh extremely concise symbolic models of
the data you're feeding into it, and then we're gonna make it scale. And so everything you're doing
with machine learning today, with parametric curves, we should be able to do it uh with symbolic
models in the future in a in a way that will be much, much closer to optimality. much closer to
optimality in the sense that you're gonna need much less data to obtain the models. The models are
gonna run much more efficiently at at inference time because they're gonna be so small. And because
they're so small, they will also generalize much better and compose much better. You know the the
minimum description length principle that the model of the data that is most likely to generalize is
the shortest. And I think you cannot find a model like this if you're doing parametric learning. You
need to you need to try symbolic learning.

Garry Tan (host): That's fascinating.

François Chollet (guest): So the rest of the industry is just pouring more and more billions of
dollars down an approach that was set years ago. Can you like help make the case for why you think
that it's the right thing to explore alternate approaches instead of just to keep putting more money
into the current approach? I mean everybody is uh is uh uh you know building on top of the LLM stack
these days, which makes sense because you know the the returns are there, like it's actually
working. So it would seem very sensible for everybody to just be doing uh what seems to be the the
the currently most proactive path. Uh but RTEX actually it's it's counterproductive to have
everybody working on the same thing. Like I personally don't think that uh machine learning or AI in
50 years is still gonna be built on this stack. I think this is a stack that is uh very nice, maybe
it even gets us to HI, uh, but it's not as efficient as it should be. I think uh it's inevitable
that uh the world of AI will uh trend over time towards optimality. And so I'm trying to sort of
like leapfrog directly uh to optimality, like to build to build the foundations of optimal AI today.
But in general, you know, I our vision is very ambitious. And I'm not saying that we're gonna be
successful, like we have maybe a a 10 or 15% chance of success. Uh but that is enough uh that it's
worth trying, right? And I think in general, like among among listeners, if you have uh a big idea
and it has very low chance of success, but uh if it works, it's gonna be big and no one else is
gonna be working on it, right? It's it's not something popular, it's not something if you don't do
it, no one else will do it. And this is basically our situation. If you're in this situation, then
you then you should you should should try a chance. You know, should should go and work on it. I
mean, that's almost like the mission statement of Y Combinator, the thing that you just said. Yeah.
Yeah. The reason it's important is that again, if we don't do it, no one else will do it. Right. So
it's worth trying. Even if we don't succeed, it's worth trying. Has the success well very
specifically of the coding agents, I guess, built on top of the LLM stack. Like, has their success
surprised you at all? And in particular, like say over the last six months or so? Yeah, absolutely.
I think it has surprised many people. It definitely did surprise me. If you look at why everything
is is starting to work so well with coding agents, it's really because uh code provides you with uh
a verifiable reward signal. And I think right now we're in this situation where any problem where
the solutions you've proposed can be uh uh formally verified and you can actually trust a reward
signal. It's not just some guess made by a model. Any domain like this uh can be fully automated
with current technology, with with the LM-based stack. And uh code is sort of like the first domain
to fall, but there will be many others in the future. I think mathematics is also is also primed to
see a a revolution in the next few years for the same reasons, again, because the domain just gives
you verifiable rewards. I guess the challenge for a formally verified domain is you have to somehow
take a domain and make it verifiable, which is the trick. I mean code is very natural. You can test
there's bugs, compiles, etcetera, and mathematics as well, whether all the theorems and proofs work
out. I guess it becomes more nebulous when you go couple degrees off where there are fields that are
not naturally formally verified. And you need to come up with a again, with some sort of a function
to come up with that reward that makes it verifiable. With very fuzzy things like let's say English
language and composing the perfect essay, how do you make that formally verifiable? Yeah, yeah,
absolutely. I mean, writing SS is, you know, the typical example of a domain that's not uh
verifiable. And so what you're gonna see is that progress of reasoning models and and base LLMs on
this type of of domain is is you know is gonna be very slow because the stack we're using, like the
LLM stack, is very, very reliant on its train data. It's basically just operationalizing the train
data. And for writing SS, the training data is coming from uh human experts, like annotating uh
answers. And that's costly. So you're gonna see this very, very slow progress. Maybe maybe it's even
gonna stall. But but for any any verifiable domain, like take code, for instance, what was the big
unlock is uh when uh when people started creating this code based like training environment uh for
for post training. Uh well the the the reward signal, the verification signal is provided by things
like uh unit tests and so on. And so that means that uh the model was not just working from human-
provided annotations. It was actually trying its own things, uh verifying the answer. and uh and
generating a lot lot more string data in the process, a much denser coverage of the problem space.
And not just coverage in terms of like is is the answer right or wrong, but also uh starting to
build uh models of the execution traces. Right. Uh so that the models could start incorporating a uh
an execution model. Very much the way that uh uh human programmers, you know, when they look at
code, they're they're sort of like executing the code in their minds, they they keep track of the
value of variables and so on. It's also what the models are trying to do now. And this is why it's
working so well. And it's possible because you're working with this very uh formal, fully verifiable
environment. You cannot do that with SS, you cannot do that with you know law or or many other
problems. I think I really like how you define intelligence and how to measure it, which brings to
the question of uh also sharing having you share the history of uh RKGI. Yeah, so my my definition
of uh general intelligence, you know, many people uh around the industry these days they say uh AGI
is gonna be a system that can automate most economically economically valuable tasks. And to me that
definition is uh it's it's about automation. It's not about intelligence, not about general
intelligence. So my definition is Uh AGI is basically going to be a system that can approach any new
problem, any new task, any new domain, and make sense of it, like model it, uh become competent at
it, uh with the same degree of efficiency as a human could. So meaning it's going to need basically
the same amount of training data uh and training compute as as a human would, which is which is very
little. Like humans are really, really uh data efficient. So General intelligence is human-level
skill acquisition efficiency on the on the same scope of tasks that uh humans could potentially uh
le learn to do. Do you think it's possible that we will accomplish the first definition of AGI, the
automated most economically useful work, before we accomplish Absolutely, I think that's that's the
trajectory that we're on right now. And I think it's already true that in principle, current
technology can fully automate at human level or beyond any domain where you have uh verifiable
rewards, right? And code code being the first one. And I think figuring out AGR, figuring out like
human level uh you know, learning efficiency of the arbitrary tasks. That's probably gonna take uh a
different sort of technology, a different a different mindset, a different approach. Do you think
that LMs can be bent to have the same sample efficiency as humans, or do you think it's like
fundamentally just impossible and we need a new approach and that's that's the thing that you're
hoping hoping to solve? With enough compute everything starts looking like everything else. Every
like computer grade equalizer, every approach starts looking the same. And I think it's possible in
principle to build something that looks a lot like a GI on top of the LLM stack. Uh, but it's not
gonna be LLM space. It's gonna be this new layer, perhaps you know, it's gonna be even a a few
layers above, not just one layer above, but a few layers above. Uh but it you you can build it on
top of uh LLMs because LLMs are kind of computer, right? Uh I do believe, however, this would be the
wrong thing to do because it would be very inefficient. I think AR, AI research will have to trend
towards uh not just efficiency but in fact optimality over time. And for this reason, future AI in a
few decades, uh it's not gonna be this uh harness on top of a reasoning model on top of a baselm. Uh
it's gonna be much, much lower than that. To Diana's question, do you want to talk about how you
actually designed Arc AGI and why it's a good barometer for that? I mean, I I you know, I've been
doing deep learning for a very, very long time. And initially my my my take, my mindset was that
deep learning was going to be able to do everything. You were the creator of Keras before even all
the other frameworks became very popular. In uh 2014. And uh from that work, uh, you know, I
actually started uh developing this open source library, which I released uh in fact uh exactly
eleven years ago, uh March, March 2015. Uh so it was Keras and and then it got popular and then I
ended up uh sort of like doing less of the research that I that I had started Keras for and uh more
of working on the framework itself just because it has really really good product market fit. And so
my my take, you know, around that time, around like twenty fifteen, twenty sixteen, was that deep
learning was extremely general, that you could do everything with deep learning, that you didn't
need anything else. That it was train complete. So uh my take was basically that deep learning was
differentiable programming. Uh so anything you would do with software, you could in principle train
a deep learning model on the right inputs and outputs to do the same thing. And uh in uh twenty
sixteen, I was doing uh research at Google Brain on trying to train deep learning models to help
with uh reasoning problems, and in particular uh uh first order logic problems, uh uh theorem
proving and so on. And I started finding that you could not really get cryon descent to encode uh uh
sort of like reasoning style algorithms. It was not because the models could not represent these
algorithms. It was because cryon descent could not find them, right? So the problem was that it
wasn't about deep learning not being chain complete or anything like that. Like i that was not the
problem. The problem was crying descent, right? Cry and descent would not find generalizable
programs. It would instead uh end up doing uh overfit pattern matching, right? Uh over over
sequences of uh uh input tokens. Because

Garry Tan (host): I guess people could argue like that's what's happening. I mean this

François Chollet (guest): still what's happening today in a in a in a slightly It's it's just it's
like a higher higher level version of it's with a lot of data. So it doesn't feel like overfitting
because the data has a lot more distribution. Yeah. With a lot more data and also uh I think models
today uh they're a lot more compressive of the data, which is why why they they generalize better.

Garry Tan (host): All models are wrong, but some models are useful. And then I guess what I'm
hearing is like your method might find the right model. That's

François Chollet (guest): right. That's uh that's uh where where the uh idea came from. And I was
like, you know, at the time in uh back in twenty sixteen, twenty seventeen, I was like, okay, we're
gonna need a a benchmark to capture these ideas. Uh we're gonna need a program synthesis benchmark.
And uh my my mental model for that was ImageNet. I was like, oh, I'm gonna make the ImageNet of
reasoning. So I started brainstorming a few ideas around like twenties, twenty seventeen. I explored
many different things. Uh I tried working with uh in particular cellular automata, like uh uh a
setup where you show a model uh cellular automata outputs and it must recreate uh the program that
generated them, like that sort of thing. Uh and eventually I settled on the uh RKGI format. uh
around like early 2018. You know, I was doing this on the side, it was a side project. Like my main
project was uh developing Keras at Google. I wasn't moving very very fast uh on that. Uh so summer
2018 uh I wrote the Arc Task Editor and then I started just making lots of tasks by hand. And about
one year later I had made one thousand tasks. And so I wrote up uh the paper that was explaining
what this was about, what the big idea was, like intelligence as a as a scale acquisition
efficiency. And and I published uh all of that in uh in uh twenty nineteen. In parallel, GPD three
twenty twenty was coming out and starting to show signs until the Chat GPT moment around twenty
twenty two end of the year. And the industry took off with that. And this was one of the benchmarks
that was really performing really badly. And it was very obscure. I don't think many people knew
about it. It was mostly niche research communities that maybe read your paper. Yeah, people who
worked on programs knew about it. Uh but a lot of people who worked on on deep learning on scaling
up LLMs, they didn't really care for it. And part of the reason why is because LLMs did not work
well or at all on the benchmark. For a benchmark to capture the attention of the research community,
it needs to start working a little. If it's too hard, people are gonna are just gonna dismiss it.

Garry Tan (host): You're just ahead of your time, clearly, because we're not on Arc AGI one anymore,
and then two is reaching saturation, and then three is out now. Yes.

François Chollet (guest): And I think the cool thing about RKGI, it has been a very good barometer
for the industry of the big changes that happened, because V V one was not working at all for a long
time until twenty twenty five when reasoning models came out, right? Yeah, absolutely. If you look
at uh quantity AI performance on Arc V1 first and then V2, uh so basal LMs uh were scoring extremely
low on V1, like sub ten percent basically. And I mean it was true of uh the original like GPT-3. I
should scoring zero. But that's even true of the latest base LLMs today, you know, as of as of
Marshall. Without reasoning six. Without reasoning. Without reasoning, yeah. So the base models. So
performance of uh of base LLMs on on V1 stayed very, very low, even though in the meantime, you
know, we had scaled up these models by 50,000 X, right? So it it was really telling you that, you
know, more scale, scaling up pre-training alone was not gonna crack the benchmark. This was not
enough. To demonstrate that the model had fluid intelligence. And then the moment started performing
well on ARC1 was with the first reasoning models. In particular, the OpenAI O1 and then O3 models,
which by the way, they were demonstrated by OpenAI on ARC, because it was the one unsaturated
reasoning benchmark that was really showing that this model was different, that had new capabilities
that we had not seen before. And so with reasoning models, you start seeing this sudden like step
function change uh on ARC one. And so ARC one was really the benchmark that signaled that at this
moment in time, something was happening. Something big. Yeah, something big, like new capabilities
were emerging. Like reasoning was new and different. And it was actually not obvious at the time.
Like, you know, I don't know if you remember when uh when uh uh O1 uh preview was was announced by
OpenAI. That was the end of 2024, actually. Yeah, December 2024. And like sure it was like uh uh uh
huge like step function progress on ARC, uh, but it was very expensive. We did not really have uh
product market for it effectively. But if you looked at uh at ARC results, you knew that this was
big and important. And then we released ARC2, which was the same format but uh more difficult, like
with more uh uh composition uh at uh at the level of the the reasoning chains. And what happened is
that so the the earliest reasoning models started very, very low on ARC2. And then around the same
time as uh coding agents started working, you saw this yeah. So very, very recently, just a few
months ago, you saw this uh uh a very, very fast like saturation uh of R2. And so again, like R2
signaled that yes, there was this uh this new set of capabilities emerging. So I think the benchmark
did a really good job at capturing the advent of reasoning models and then the advent uh of uh
agentic coding. Like this this new pattern where if you have uh verifiable rewards then you can
basically fully automate uh the domain which by the way is through arc like arc does provide a a
verifiable reward.

Garry Tan (host): I guess for V2, what what caused the so one was clearly reasoning. Two, a
benchmark doesn't care how you solve it. I guess embedded in what you said, like were people using
code gen to then solve it.

François Chollet (guest): That's right. It's not not necessarily code gen, uh per se, but uh the
Frontier Labs have been targeting ARG V2. And uh the progress you saw on R V two is actually a
result uh of this very, very large scale targeting. So what you can do to solve R V two is you asked
your reasoning model to make more tasks like those in the benchmark. uh and then you try to solve
them using let's say let's say program induction for instance, uh uh still using your reasoning
model. Then you verify the solution. Again it's verifiable, so you can you can trust uh the answer.
Um and then you fine-tune the model on the successful reasoning chains and then you keep repeating
like you generate new tasks, you solve them, you verify the solution, you fine-tune the model on the
reasoning chains. And um you can keep doing this millions of times, right? Like the the you just
need to spend more money.

Garry Tan (host): This is the RL loop that is happening, yeah. And the

François Chollet (guest): the new paradigm in AI is basically that any domain where this is true,
where you have uh the ability to generate these uh these uh true uh uh verification signals, you you
can run this this kind of loop, right? And if you can run this kind of loop, you can mine uh you can
brute force mine effectively the entire space and get extremely high performance. This is basically
the the process through which Arc2 was saturated. So what it tells you is that it's not so much that
the models have higher fluid intelligence than than they did with the with the first freezing
models. It's just that you have this new paradigm of post-training. And this is exactly what led to
agency coding. So it does matter. It is it is valuable. It is useful.

Garry Tan (host): It's not that the mod models are smarter, it's that they're suddenly more useful.
It is possible to be more useful in particular domains without being smarter. Yeah. Clearly, because
that's means good things for me. I'm not getting any smarter right now. Like at at a you know, age
forty five. But, you know, I can learn how to do things and that's sort of what's happening with the
models as of like late.

François Chollet (guest): Yeah, absolutely. When when it comes to uh competency, there's always a
trade-off between intelligence and knowledge. If you have more knowledge, if you have better
training, uh, you need less intelligence to be competent. And that's exactly uh uh uh what happened
with the the rise of coding agents, right? The models don't have higher fluid intelligence per se,
they don't have like a higher uh uh IQ, so to speak. It's just that they're way better trained. And
they're way better trained in uh in two ways. So they they're not just trying to auto-complete code
anymore. They're actually trained via trial and error in these uh RL uh postering environments with
you know true reward signals and also they're trained uh to embed this uh model of code execution,
right? Where they they they they they learn to keep track of the value of variables uh uh over an
execution cycle. And that's what what's leading to this extremely strong product market for it uh of
agency coding today. And three it's completely changing software engineering.

Garry Tan (host): This has happened not too long ago, the saturation. We actually had the founders
of Poetic that came and spoke about the approach, which is really sounds like this new way of uh
getting LMs to perform is building this uh agent hardness, right? And the hardness is basically
structuring a problem domain into something that can be formally verified. And they did that
basically for ARC v2, which uh when they released it, they were at the top of the benchmark. But
then the crazy thing is I actually worked with a company in the winter twenty-six batch, not too
long ago, called Confluence Labs, which actually ended up saturating the V2 results with 97%. And I
think their task cost was uh a lot more efficient too. And the approach they basically took is
similar to this. I think they built the hardnesses on top of it in order to get the LLMs to to go
and build different tasks and program through it. Yeah. Which then for me I was like, wow, is this
batch? And during the batch, they only worked on it for a couple of months and they were able to
saturate this batch mark that has been around for a long time. It's like something special is
happening.

François Chollet (guest): Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of progress right now that's driven by uh custom
harnesses around the task. And the harness is basically a way for the the human programmer to um
input into the model like uh higher level like uh solution strategies basically. I mean to me the
fact that you need humans to engineer these harnesses is also a sign that we're we're we're short of
AGI today because if we had a GI, you know, HGI would just make its own harness. It would not need
to be told how to solve a problem, it would just figure it out. But it is very effective. Like
harnesses, I don't think they get us closer to a GI in any sense. Uh but they're it's a very
valuable area of research because that can lead to task automation at scale.

Garry Tan (host): YC's next batch is now taking applications. Got a startup in you? Apply at
ycombinator.com slash apply. It's never too early and filling out the app will level up your idea.
Okay, back to the video. Can you tell us about then what V3 is gonna measure that's uh just got
released?

François Chollet (guest): Yeah, absolutely. So if you look at V1, V2, uh it was really focusing on
your ability to uh produce like causal models uh of a pattern that was just given to you, like the
data was given to you. Uh so it was static, it was uh passive and really focused on uh modeling. And
uh V three it's completely different. We are trying to measure uh agentic intelligence. So it's
interactive, it's active, like the data is not provided to you, you must go get it. The idea is that
your agent is dropped into a new environment, which is kind of like a a mini video game. And it's
not provided any instructions, it's not told what to do, it's not told uh what the goal even is or
what the controls even are. And it must figure out everything on its own via trial and error. So we
are we are not just uh measuring, you know, the uh the AI's ability to model its environment, we're
also looking at uh its exploration efficiency, its ability to acquire goals on its own, like goal
setting. and of course its ability to plan uh through the model of the environment that's created
and and to execute the plan. Uh and so together, you know, all all of these abilities we call that
agentic intelligence. And we are looking for AI systems that could learn to play these games and and
you know crack them with the same degree of action efficiency as a human. Like if you look at the
human, they are dropped into this new environment, they they try a few things, they start
understanding how things work. uh they can they can solve the environment you know in in a few
hundreds to thousands factions. We're trying to look for AI systems that could match uh this
efficiency. And by the way, we know that all of these test environments in Arc3 are solvable by
humans with no prior training because we actually uh tested them uh on on regular people. Yeah, at
first you just see this this screen and you uh you know you have uh these keys available, but you
don't know what they do, and you must figure out everything from scratch. And humans are really good
at that, by the way. They're really good at exploring efficiently at making sense of something new
and eventually cracking the game.

Garry Tan (host): And frontier models today they're not very good at it. If the reasoning models
cracked V one and the like reinforcement learning environments cracked V two, do do we need a new
advance to crack V three? Did the do do even the best techniques currently like not work?

François Chollet (guest): Yeah, I mean I'm pretty curious to see how Frontier Labs are gonna react
to V3 and how they're gonna start to target it. Um it is designed to be more resistant uh to the
same kind of uh darkness strategy as what we saw for V2 in in particular. Like of course you can try
to just make more Arc 3 like games and then train your agents uh in them. Um but the thing is we've
uh deliberately tried to create a private set of environments that is significantly different from
the public set. Like you can look at the public set, but it's not actually giving you that much
information about what's in the private set. Uh in the private set you will have very different
games with very different concepts. And also the public set is meant to be substantially easier. So
your performance on the public set is not actually it's not representative of how well the system
would do on the private set. So for this reason it's gonna be harder to target. Uh and that makes it
a better test of fluid intelligence as opposed to a test of how much effort you put into into
cracking it.

Garry Tan (host): I'm so curious, how do you come up with these games? They're so creative.

François Chollet (guest): Yeah, we set up a an entire uh uh video game studio, right, to to create
them. Uh so we got uh over 250 games. Uh and you know they're they they're pretty quick to play,
like uh each game takes you maybe 10 minutes or or or a bit less uh uh to play from scratch, like up
upon first contact. And we have like 250 plus and uh we set up this uh uh a very productive game
studio where we had any given week we had uh multiple games uh in progress. We had like this this
pipeline uh including you know design, implementation, uh review, human testing, and and uh and uh
many many iteration cycles to to to make sure that the the the game comes out right.

Garry Tan (host): Who who's working in the studio? Right. Uh we creators. Yeah, we hired a a team of
game developers and we built our own game engine. Wow, so so it's actually people who like
previously worked in the game in the in the video game industry.

François Chollet (guest): That's right, that's right. So one thing to be in mind though is that the
games in Arc3 are unique, right? They're they're trying to not borrow elements, concepts from
previous video games. They're built entirely on top of uh core knowledge priors, like things like
just just you know elementary knowledge, like basic physics, uh understanding of objects, uh
understanding of the notion of uh agents, for instance, like an agent in objects with goals and in
intent intentions. But we are we are not incorporating any language, any like cultural symbols like
you know arrows, for instance, Uh or the color green meaning go and color red meaning star, that
sort of thing. Uh there's no external knowledge that's involved uh in these games.

Garry Tan (host): It's like one of those uh IQ tests that are just pattern matching, but now it has
time series.

François Chollet (guest): Yeah. Uh in Synodist time series it's interactive. You must create your
own path through game space, right? You m you must you know in in in an IQ test like problem like
you know what arc one and two is, the data that you must model is provided to you. You already have
the data. You just you just need to find the causal rule to explain it. With arc three actually you
must gather the data. Uh and you must do so efficiently. Like of course you could say, well, I'm
just gonna, you know, brute force mine uh the space of uh every possible game state, and then I'll
find the solution. You cannot do that because if if you try to do that, you would score extremely
low, even if you manage to solve the level, uh, because you're scored on your efficiency. You must
match human level efficiency.

Garry Tan (host): It's funny, it's like a almost uh coming full circle. This level of AGI with games
sort of is the match pair to open AI writing. I mean, you know, Tom Brown, uh one of the co founders
of Anthropic, had to write like the harness code to allow like the you know, pre GPT AI at OpenAI to
play StarCraft.

François Chollet (guest): Yeah, yeah, OpenAI worked on uh on uh in particular on uh on Dota too. Uh
they had the OpenAI five model, which was if I recall correctly, so this was like not just pre GPT,
but uh also mostly pre transformers because they were working with a stack of LSTM um uh layers, if
I recall correctly. And even before Open AI, uh DeepMind worked a lot on video game, uh uh you know,
solving video games via Deep Aisle. uh and they were the first to do uh uh Atari games right back in
twenty thirteen. That you know they were very very early very very visionary in that sense to to
work on on this problem so early with these methods uh which are still very modern methods. So the
big difference is that if you look at um at Atari games for instance or Eventola, you're training uh
on on the same environment as what you use for testing. So effectively you're just trying to
memorize the best strategies. You're trying to uh at at training time explore the full uh space of
possible game states. And productionize, operationalize uh that knowledge into the model, and then
uh at inference time, you're basically just recalling that knowledge. And that's explicitly what
we're trying to avoid with arc three. Uh you're not playing games uh that you've seen before, you're
not playing games that you've been trained on, like for millions of files, like the the OpenAI Five
model, for instance, was playing uh a restricted version of Dota 2. And it was trained on like tens
of thousands of of hours of gameplay effectively. I think may maybe in millions. But it was just an
insane amount of training data. With ARC3, you're being evaluated on games that you're seeing for
the very first time. And every action you spend exploring is counted towards your efficiency score.
Right. So you're really focused on measuring fluid intelligence, your ability to efficiently
explore, efficiently produce a world model uh of the environment, and then use this model uh to
infer goals, uh plan towards these goals. Uh and and eventually cry the game.

Garry Tan (host): One of the arguments for um you know NDA is that you're able to do all of the
intelligent tasks for, you know, an ARC task might be like 0.3 cent you know cents for an ARC task,
but you know, for the same task on a foundation model with LLMs, you know, a dollar to ten dollars.
And then there's this other aspect that we've been tracking where it seems like uh more and more
intelligence, um, at least on the LLM side, uh, can be distilled down into smaller and smaller
models. And so on the one hand, like they're scaling up, but then they're like distilling smarter
and smarter small models. I guess your approach might indicate that it's not billions of parameters,
like the you know, NDA achieving AGI might not be i you know, sort of inherently a scale thing at
all. There's a platonic ideal of the NDA model that achieves AGI. Yeah. Do you ever think about it
in terms of like, well, it would fit on a floppy disk?

François Chollet (guest): Well, okay. There are there are two things to separate. There's the sort
of like fluid intelligence engine. I think it's gonna be a very, very small code base, uh and a very
small set of models associated with it. And it's probably gonna be on the order of megabytes, right?
And then you have the knowledge base, so to speak. uh that's gonna be uh layered uh below this this
fluid intelligence engine like you know fluid intelligence has to draw on some knowledge and that
knowledge is gonna take up a lot more space. But I think it's it's uh it's important to to
differentiate the two. I do believe that you know when we create a GI retrospectively it will turn
out that it's a code base that's less than 10,000 lines of code. And that if you had if you had
known about it back in the in the nineteen eighties, you could have done a GI back then. Oh, yeah.
Using the the computer resources available back. Wow, that's a crazy prediction. That's I I think
retrospectively this will turn out like uh to be to be true. Wow. So it was just like hiding under
our noses in plain sight for like forty years. It took us like forty years to figure it out. That's

Garry Tan (host): right, that's right. Well, that second thing sounds like Douglas Lennat's like
psych project, or is that the wrong way to think about it? It's like there's sort of knowledge about
the world. Yeah. And then there's methods. Like the program, what I hear is like the program might
be 10,000 lines and then it operates on like on

François Chollet (guest): knowledge based it's very large. So the problem with psych, uh I mean th
th there were many issues with it, but one of the big issues is that uh there was no learning
involved.

Garry Tan (host): Yeah. It was just the knowledge like the

François Chollet (guest): knowledge was uncrafted.

Garry Tan (host): It was like purely symbolic knowledge and it was probably inaccurate. The way

François Chollet (guest): you want to be building a GI is that you want to be removing humans from
the improvement loop as much as possible. You don't want a system where every improvement in system
capability has to involve a human engineer doing something. It's actually the strength of deep
learning and foundation models. Is that you can just scale up the knowledge base. Like an LLM is
effectively a knowledge base. It's a bank uh of uh of you know modular uh vector programs that map
patterns of input tokens to patterns of output tokens, and you can scale up that knowledge base by
just adding training data and training compute with no further human involvement. I mean, of course,
there's still a little bit of human involvement in in making sure the training job completes, but
it's it's minor. You've managed to remove humans. uh from this improvement loop as much as possible.
And that's also uh what we want for our system. We want a system that's uh self-improving where the
improvements are compounding, meaning that every time the system uh increases its capabilities, it's
also increasing the rate at which it increases its capabilities.

Garry Tan (host): I think this is a Pascalism. It's like I'm sorry the essay is so long. Uh if I had
more time I would make it shorter. Yeah.

François Chollet (guest): When you're looking at uh at a heart problem, it's Actually harder to
produce a short, elegant, concise solution than a messy over-engineered solution. Yeah, you could
brute

Garry Tan (host): force it, but you know the more elegant version is very, very short. And that's
kinda like what you said with how this might come about. This

François Chollet (guest): is this is yeah, this is literally the shape Of the type of AI approach uh
we are creating. And I think this is also the shape uh of science itself. Like science is
fundamentally uh a symbolic compression process where you're looking at uh a big mass of
observations, like you know, the the position of planets in the sky or something like that, and
you're compressing that down to uh a a very simple symbolic rule. You're saying, like, yeah, like
All these thousands of observations, actually just all uh this one simple equation. That's symbolic
compression. And to do this, by the way, uh you need the model uh to be symbolic. Like you you you
you could not fit a curve and say, well, you know, that that curve is my model. That would never be
optimal, it would never be concise or elegant enough. And that's not what science is doing. Science
is not about curve-fitting. Science is about finding the equation, finding the most compressive
symbolic model of your part of observation. And that's the process that you're trying to recreate in
software form. Like you could say that uh the NDI approach to program synthesis is that we are
building science incarnate, science, the scientific method in in in algorithmic form. I'm curious if
you compare it to biology. Clearly, LLMs don't learn the way that humans do, because no baby reads
the whole internet. Do you think program synthesis is closer to the way that humans learn? Or do you
think that's yet a third branch where even if program synthesis is correct, there will be some yet
as undiscovered third way to do it, which is the thing that we do? I think so. Uh I do think humans
do some. amount of program synthesis. I think the the way humans learn and the way the the human
mind works is very messy. It's not like there's one simple elegant principle behind it all. It's an
implementation of fundamental principles, the fundamental principles of of intelligence, which you
know I think we can identify these principles and re-implement intelligence from scratch, from first
principles, in a way that will be much more efficient than the human brain. I think the human brain
is messy and it's it can be a good source of inspiration for AI, but I think it would be
counterproactive to just try uh to you know observe it and re-implement it like uh and and and make
it biologically plausible. Uh I think that's counterproductive. That's not what we're trying to do
at NDR. We're really trying to find what are the first principles of intelligence and what is the
system that would best implement them. But yeah, I do believe the human mind does at the highest
level uh something that looks a lot like program synthesis. Like we're we're currently building
causal models of our surroundings. Like we're we're describing our surroundings in our mind as, you
know, sort of objects and agents and and relations. uh between objects uh that are fundamentally
symbolic and causal in nature. This is exactly the process that lets us uh uh generalize so well and
adapt so well to novelty on the fly. I'm curious about NDA, sort of the company as you're as you're
building it. Um we've all here heard sort of the open AI founding story, and it but something that's
always struck with me is just like both Sam and Greg say that it was a little odd in the early days
'cause they didn't actually know what to do. Sort of just like a bunch of people like hanging out in
an apartment. I would love to hear kind of what's that been like for India? Like what did like the
day one look like? And just maybe for just people who are interested in starting these alternative
approaches who don't have sort of a researchy background, how should they think about that? Yeah. So
we we started on day one with the symbolic learning vision. Like we basically knew that we wanted to
do uh symbolic program synthesis, that we wanted to create a new approach to machine learning where
uh you replace parametric curves with the shortest possible symbolic models. And then the big
question was: okay, so how do we find these models? We started from uh the the the base idea, which
is still the idea that we are following today, which we were doing we are gonna do uh deep learning
guided. program search that you have a symbolic search space to explore and it's big, it's in fact
combinatorial. You're not going to make progress uh if you just use brute force. Uh it's not going
to scale. Uh you have to break the combinatorial wall and the way to do it is to add is to add uh
deep learning guidance. It's actually very similar to uh the principles that underlie something like
AlphaGo or AlphaZero. That was our s our our starting point. We also, you know, didn't have very
clear ideas about how to how to build it. So we we tried many different things, we tried many, many
different ideas. And um it took us half a year roughly uh to to to get to good foundations. uh where
we we could start building a system that compounds. And I think that's what's really important uh
when when doing a lab like this, that you don't want to be in a situation where you're constantly
trying something new. It's not reusing any learnings, any findings from the previous approaches. You
want a compounding stack. You want to build reusable foundations and then the next layer and then
the next layer. And the the the uh and of course you you you want to be building onto the right
foundation. So don't uh commit to the to the foundation layer too early, but also make sure that at
some point you're building this this compounding structure. And that that's that's the situation
that uh that we're in now. Is arc three the end or will there be an arc four, five, six? Can you
keep making it harder? Yeah, yeah, I I think there there will absolutely be arc four and and arc
five. I mean, we're currently planning arc five. Um the the point of the arc AGI benchmark series is
not to say that, well, you know, here's this test. If you pass it, this is a GI. Um Instead what
you're trying to do is we're target we're targeting uh the residual gap of fair capabilities. Like
Frontier is advancing and we're saying, well, uh if you compare it to you to to human abilities,
there's all these tasks, all these things, it's now doing well. So we're gonna create a benchmark to
target that. Uh and so it's a moving target, right? It's it's not fixed points, it's a moving
target. So there will be arc four, which will be uh in the spirit of arc three, but more focused on
continual learning. and and curriculum learning at longer timescales. So you're gonna you're gonna
have fewer games, uh, but they're gonna have way more levels. And the levels are gonna be
compounding, meaning that for for each level you need to reuse stuff that you've learned before.
Then there's gonna be arc 5. And I'm actually really really excited about ARC5. It's very very new
and different. And it's all about invention. And I mean you you you will see you will see what that
means. Eventually I expect we will run out of things to test, like as uh as we get closer to AGI, um
eventually there will be no measurable difference uh between human capabilities and particularly
human learning efficiency and and frontier AI. And when that happens, when it when it becomes
effectively impossible to measure the gap, this is the AGI moment.

Garry Tan (host): Well then the machines will take over and then they will create Arc ASI one. Yes,
arc ASI. And then it'll continue from there. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. If you had to put a guess, I mean
years, decades, months.

François Chollet (guest): Uh my timeline to a GI. You know, if you if you just try to to extrapolate
from the the current rate of progress and the amount of investment that's going into not just the
LLM stack but also like uh side ideas, side bets that might work out, like you know, NDI for
instance. I think we're probably looking at AGI twenty thirty, early twenty thirties, uh most
likely. So around the time uh the two are gonna be releasing like maybe ARC six or arc seven, uh,
that's probably gonna be AGI. You guys are doing a different approach to LLMs. Um, do you think
there's room for more startups to explore other new approaches? And are there any other ones that
you think are promising but don't have time to explore yourself? Yeah, absolutely. I mean there are
many different approaches that you could try. I've said like compute is a is a great equalizer. I
think if you look at the amount of compute and resources that we've thrown at uh deep learning and
and gradient descent and and scaling that up, if you had thrown the same amount of investment into
almost anything else, you would also have seen ex extremely exciting results, like genetic
algorithms, for instance. Uh if you try to scale up genetic algorithms, I mean I'm sure you can do
incredible things with that. Um you could you could in fact probably do new new science, uh, because
uh uh that's based on search, and search is the is the is the best fit for uh automating the
scientific method. Uh I think so right now there's also like approaches that uh build on top of the
current stack, but there's slightly alternative like uh state space models for instance. Uh there's
uh the the XLSCM architecture, like you can you can basically, you know, current frontier is it's
it's a stack of things and you you can take any layer in the stack and try to propose an
alternative. Like if you propose an extensive architecture, uh you can be doing, for instance, like
yeah, like more like uh recurrent models instead of transformers uh for the for the architecture. Uh
or you can do even lower level, you're gonna be like, okay. We're still gonna be training uh
parametric curves, but we're gonna get rid of current descent, right? We're gonna use like search.
Maybe you're gonna do new evolution. Uh that's that's lower level. And the lowest level is uh the
low the level where where we're operating, where we're saying, well actually uh forget about curves,
uh forget about parametric learning, for forget about ground descent, we're just gonna do something
completely different. Um, and I think if you want to build optimal AI, you're kind of forced to go
back to the foundation of the stack. It cannot be like uh uh one one layer added on top of the pile.
So do you think for aspiring researchers to want to do a new Neo Lab with a different approach, they
should be reading research papers from the 70s or 80s and go deeply in those with approaches that
were not as invested nowadays? That is actually a great idea because uh Earlier in the in the
history of the EI research timeline, people were exploring more things and very different things.
You had this sort of like collapse of everything into one approach. It's actually kind of a bad
idea. Uh like consider that not too long ago, like about about twenty years ago. We had the collapse
into S VMs too. Yeah, I mean it's it wasn't I wouldn't describe it as a collapse because there there
weren't that many people doing SGMs and AI was a much, much uh smaller field back then. But there
was this uh uh widespread understanding that neural networks were were a failed approach, that
neural networks didn't work. And it it was waste of time to to to keep trying to nineties, right?
Yeah. No, even even in the in the in the late uh two thousands, this was this was a set of things.
Uh basically like when when I got into into AI, uh people were telling me like, hey, neural networks
don't don't try that. I was like, Yeah, but It it looks a lot like what the brain is doing. Like I'm
I'm interested in that. If everybody is working on something, you are discarding ideas that will uh
actually turn out to be very proactive ideas, right? And yeah, like back in the 70s, back in the
80s, people are trying more things. And I think genetic algorithm is actually a very good example of
that. Uh I think this is an approach that has a tremendous amount of potential, but there's there's
not too many people are looking into scaling it up uh deeply.

Garry Tan (host): Are there any characteristics that you would be looking for? I mean, is it as
simple as like if there's a scaling law that could happen, then even if it's a different or is it is
that too like, you know, thinking by analogy?

François Chollet (guest): I think you are looking for approaches that scale. Yeah. Uh I think it's
it's a non-starter. If you're working on something, but the only way to increase the capabilities of
the system is to have uh human engineers and researchers spend time on it. It will not work. Because
even if the idea is very clever and very elegant and works really well, capabilities are gonna be
bounded. They're gonna be bounded by human investment. Right. You want to be in a setup where the
system can improve its capabilities with no human in the loop, with no humanity.

Garry Tan (host): So you won't say like, don't just do it the way we did it like ten years ago. Do
it with the idea that recursive self improvement is baked in at the beginning.

François Chollet (guest): Yeah, not necessarily recursive self improvement because deep learning,
for instance, is not is not recursively self improving, but with the idea of scaling up with no
human bottlenecks. You want to remove the human from from the improvement loop. The great strength
of deep learning is that the models got better and better simply by adding uh uh training training
compute and training data. I mean it's it's a little bit of a caricature because of course just
adding these factors requires a lot of human involvement. But basically that's the idea is that you
have this decoupling from uh the improvement curve and the amount of human effort that's needed to
be injected into the system. I guess, or human effort that's already happened. Because the LMs do
actually require an enormous amount of human effort. It's just it was the human effort to build the
internet and we'd already built it. Yeah. Actually less and less now uh that we are doing uh
training in uh interactive viable environments. Right. Because then you only need a small amount of
human effort to create the environment. And from that small amount of effort you're you're creating
exponentially more training data. But at first, I think to sort of like Prime the machine. You need
this tremendous amount uh of uh of uh uh human generated abstractions encoded in text data. And if
you if you don't start from that, you you cannot get the system into this loop.

Garry Tan (host): Do you have any advice for me uh starting a open source project? Things to do,
things not to do in uh in the AI space, because I am uh not sure how I signed up for this in the
last fourteen days, but I think I have, I don't know, on the order of like ten to thirty thousand
people using G Stack every day.

François Chollet (guest): Yeah, it's wild.

Garry Tan (host): Yeah. And I don't know like I have a job. I guess like, you know, what was it like
to start Keras and how did you keep maintaining it? How what's a good maintainer? Like, what did you
learn from that? I don't know. This might be a whole hour.

François Chollet (guest): Yeah, I mean that's lots of learnings from growing growing Keras. Uh so
right now I'm less involved with it. Uh there's a big team at Google that's working on it and
they're doing an amazing job.

Garry Tan (host): So it is possible to not to you know to put people together to like it is possible
to

François Chollet (guest): start something. Yeah, it is possible to start something. That's a relief.
Uh and and and then get more people involved and at some point it becomes its own thing. And just,
you know, it it used to be your baby, but now it's all it's all grown up and it's all adult and and
and going on is its own life. So if you ask me the the the factors that remade KERAS successful. Um
I mean first of all is that there was this big focus on uh making the the API simple and intuitive.
There was this big big focus on usability. And this was inspired by ScikitLearn. Like ScikitLearn
was sort of like the OG uh machine learning library for Python. And what made it successful was that
it was so easy to get started with it. So at first I was like, okay, uh I'm gonna package uh all
this functionality I've created under really, really simple APIs, gonna be like the circuit learn
API. That was like the big idea. The focus on usability is not just making sure the API is simple,
it's also making sure the entire uh onboarding experience is nice and easy. Like the docs should be
very informative. You should, you know, the docs should be. not just telling you about how to use
this thing, but they should actually be teaching you about the domain in the first place. Because
the the folks who land on your website, they're not going to be already deep learning experts.
They're going to be people looking to maybe start using deep learning. And so you you have to teach
them not just how to use the tool, but what the tool is good for, um and and the entire field around
it. And then you have to put a lot of investment into community building. Um one thing we uh we did
a bit uh uh at Google, in fact, you know, Google made it kinda kinda difficult and and I was sad
about that, is uh hire your power users. Like hire your fans. This this is a really, really good
idea. Yeah. Like find find the the most enthusiastic users from your community. Yeah, and and and
just hire

Garry Tan (host): them on your team. Amazing. Yeah.

François Chollet (guest): And uh done the always the best people,

Garry Tan (host): right? All right. Time to start g stack.org. Uh put in a bunch of my own money and
then hire a bunch of people to work on it. That sounds good. I think you've been a leader and
pioneer and we so lucky to have you sit with us. There are people watching who are at the beginning
of their, you know, adulthood even, like their cur certainly their professional careers. Uh or
actually like people just around the world. They're like trying to understand like what does this
mean as intelligence becomes broadly applicable? Like, what would you tell you know, if you were
eighteen right now, what would you tell them?

François Chollet (guest): Yeah. I mean th there's a lot of people today who have very uh
pessimistic, very negative takes about the the rise in AI capabilities. They say, Oh, you know, uh
I'm gonna be out of a job soon, uh there's gonna be mass unemployment, uh AI is just gonna take over
completely. And my my take is actually, you know, the more you know, the more expertise you have
about things like programming, for instance, the better you're able to use and leverage these tools
for your own benefit. And with the right kind of expertise, uh all this AI progress is actually
empowerment. Like it's something that you can leverage for yourself. I mean that's that's exactly
what you did with your project, right? Yeah. And yeah, more people should have this mindset of
trying to learn as much as possible, not just about AI, uh, but about the the domain that they want
uh uh to apply AI to, right? So that they should they should seek to turn this uh uh this this new
development into an opportunity, into into a tool they can use for themselves to improve their own
lives. I think that's that's the right mindset because you know you're not gonna stop uh AI
progress. I think I think it's too late for that. And so the next question is okay, like AI progress
is here. Uh it's actually gonna keep accelerating. How do you make use of it? How do you leverage?
How do you ride a wave? That's the question to ask.

Garry Tan (host): I wish we could uh keep going for a couple hours 'cause I'm sure we could.
Francois, François, you so much for spending time with us.

François Chollet (guest): Thanks so much for having me.
