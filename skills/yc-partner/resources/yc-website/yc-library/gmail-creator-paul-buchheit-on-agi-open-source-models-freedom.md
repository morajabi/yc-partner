## Transcript

Host: It seems like Google has all the ingredients to just be the dominant AI company in the world.
Why isn't it? Do you think OpenAI in 2016 was comparable to Google in 1999 when you joined it? Are
you a believer that we are definitely going to get to AGI? What is the long-term trajectory of AI?
It's the most powerful technology we've ever invented, and so the question is like, where does that
power go? I think we have to build a whole coalition of people who are in favor of freedom and open
source and not just sort of bet everything on Facebook saving us.

Host: Welcome to another episode of the Lightcone. I'm Gary. This is Jared Harge and Diana, and
we're the partners at Y Combinator where we funded hundreds of billions of dollars worth of
companies. And we have a special guest who is also one of the original outside partners, the non-
founding partners at YC, Paul Buchheit. He created Gmail. He coined the term "Don't Be Evil." PB,
thanks for joining us today.

Paul Buchheit: Thanks, Gary.

Host: So what should we start off with?

Paul Buchheit: Well, I think one thing people don't often realize is that you've been thinking about
AI for a long time, and that Google itself was kind of an AI company. Can you tell us more about
that? What was the internal view of AI at Google?

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I mean, I think really Google was always supposed to be an AI company from the
beginning. You know, Larry and Sergey set out to build these very large compute clusters and do a
lot of machine learning on all of the data that they gather. And actually, arguably, you know, the
mission statement is pretty straightforward. The Google mission is to gather all the world's
training data and feed it into a giant AI supercomputer. And they put it slightly less directly.
They said, "Gather all the world's information and make it universally useful and accessible," or
something like that. But essentially, you know, what that really meant in practice is feeding it
into a giant AI supercomputer. And even the origin story of Google was all based on their PhD with
PageRank, which is very much today in a lot of machine learning classes, it gets taught as one of
the foundational, kind of historical AI algorithms that gets taught.

Host: Yeah, I mean there was an understanding very early on that if you have enough data, that's
actually the path to making things intelligent instead of just trying to iterate forever on little
algorithms. How early did you join Google, Paul? Can you talk a little bit about what Google was
like when you joined?

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, so it was June 1999. So that was, uh, let's see, 25 years ago, a little more.
And so yeah, it was a very small startup. We were in Palo Alto on University Avenue, just up above
like a T-shop at the time. And it was electric. It was really cool. Um, I actually, after I was
there for about a week, I tried to get more equity. But it turns out you have to negotiate before
accepting. Um, so but yeah, it had a very kind of unreal sense of just excitement, you know? I was
excited to go into work because we were just doing big things.

Host: When you were there, like in that early set of Google people, how did you all envision that
this AI thing would play out? And what Google's like AI future would look like?

Paul Buchheit: You know, we didn't. Something that ever came up, right? No, I mean, AI is obviously
been a thing that people have been thinking about for a long time. Um, I made my first neural net
back. I dug up the code a while back. I think it was like 1995. And it was like one of those three-
layer neural nets. Do you do the classic MNIST digit classification thing?

Host: Yeah.

Paul Buchheit: I was doing. I did a, uh, not exactly digit classification, but there were these
things called figlets that are like ASCII letters. And so I made it do essentially like an OCR on
those. Um, but you know, it'd be like 100 weights or something. It's very much smaller than today's
models, which are like trillions of weights now.

Host: Yeah, and the history of like neural nets is kind of weird. Um, the first thing was when they
invented the perceptron, which was like a single neuron, and it was very hot for a short time until
some researcher showed that a perceptron can't compute XOR. And then they were like, "Well, it's
just dead for a while," until someone had this idea to use multiple neurons. And so it was like very
slow going. And then it was kind of like dead again for a while. And then, to my perception, it kind
of really picked up in the early teens, you know, when deep learning became popular. And that was
when we first started seeing, I think, impressive results. That was when we started feeling like,
internally, you know, in the discussions at YC, that AI had switched from being something in the
indefinite future to being in the more definite future. Um, and that is, you know, kind of what led
to the creation of OpenAI as well.

Host: Were there any conversations around like the power of AI and the implications of AI?
Specifically AGI and just like the impact on society? Or did it feel too far removed?

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I think it was still too far off in the future. I mean, it was very much sci-fi
at that point. Um, we were dealing with more, you know, near-term. How do we make search better? But
search is, you know, kind of, to some extent, an AI problem. You have to figure out what it is the
user is looking for. It's remarkably good if you actually look at Google Search. Like, there's a lot
of stuff going on behind the scenes. Um, and actually, one of the earliest kind of magical features
that we added was the "did you mean," you know, the spell correction. And so that actually comes
from originally just my inability to spell. I've never been very good at spelling. My brain doesn't
like arbitrary patterns. So like, when I was in school, math was easy because it's predictable, but
spelling always made me struggle. Um, and so when I started at Google, one of the first features I
added was a spell corrector because I was looking at the query logs and I would see that I'm not the
only person with this problem. Like, a third of the queries were misspelled or something like that.
So it was like the easiest quality win ever was just to fix the spelling.

Host: Wait, wait, so you built the original spelling corrector at Google?

Paul Buchheit: I, um, I did the first "did you mean" feature. Um, and so, but I built it just based
off of kind of an existing spell corrector library. And then, but it would give really dumb
corrections. Like, if you typed in Turbo Tax, it would try to correct it to "turbot axe," turbot
being a type of fish. Um, and so I did some basic, like, statistical filtering that would say,
"That's an idiotic correction, don't show it," and so I would just like filter the results. And then
I was working on building a better spell corrector because I knew, you know, we could just use all
of the data we had. We had a copy of the web and we had billions of search queries. There's like a
lot of information there. So I was working on making something better. And then I was just using it
as an interview question. So when I would interview engineers, I would be like, "How would you build
a spell corrector?" And I would say like 80 percent of engineers had no idea.

Host: Yeah.

Paul Buchheit: And the other 20 percent gave sort of mediocre answers. But then there was this like
one guy who gave a really, really good answer. Um, it's just like he was ahead of where I was
already. So I was like, "We have to hire him." Um, and so his first project, he started, I think it
was end of 2000, kind of like late December. His, I gave him as his like intro project, I just gave
him all of my code and showed him how to run projects on the cluster. Um, and then I went away for a
couple weeks for Christmas. And when I came back, he had invented what we now know as like the "did
you mean" feature. And so he did all of that in like his first two weeks at Google. And it was like
this incredible thing that could spell correct my last name, you know? No one had ever done a spell
corrector that would correct proper nouns and things like that. Um, and so that person was Noam
Shazir, who then is also the person who later on invented AI. So he's one of the key people on the
"All You Need Is Attention" paper. And then he's since started Character AI.

Host: I never connected those dots. But I remember in 2000 when the original Google spelling
corrector launched, it was a big deal because it was one of the first instances of AI that was like
widely used by the general population, because the earlier spelling correctors, they had all been
very simple things based on just like a list of dictionary words and edit distance. And so it
couldn't handle proper nouns. It made all kinds of like dumb suggestions. The Google one was the
first one that was trained on real data.

Paul Buchheit: Exactly. So actually worked, right? So the Google spell corrector has no dictionary.
It's just based on looking at the web and at query logs and that, just predicting what is the, you
know, most likely correction.

Host: It seems like Google has been working on AI for a long time. It has the data, the compute, the
people. It has all the ingredients to just be the dominant AI company in the world. Why isn't it?
What do you think happened? It seemed like it got stuck someplace.

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I mean, I don't know exactly. So, you know, just to clarify for everyone, I
don't work at Google. Um, I left in 2006. Um, but my perception, you know, as an outsider, I think a
lot of it kind of happened, especially around the time of the transition to Alphabet, when you know,
the company was no longer really being run by the founders so much, and especially, you know, after
they left. Um, and I think it became more about protecting and preserving the search monopoly. And
so if you think about it from that perspective, they have, you know, this goldmine. Like, search is
just so valuable. Um, and AI is an inherently disruptive technology, both in terms of maybe breaking
the search, you know, business model, where if you actually give people the right answer, they won't
need to click on an entire page full of ads. There is, and this was noted of course in the very
original Google paper back in 1998, that a search company has an inherent tension between
profitability and giving the right answer because there's always a temptation that if you make your
results worse, people will actually click on more ads. Um, and so AI has the potential to disrupt
that. But I think even more than that, it has the potential to completely anger regulators. Um, and
so a lot of Google's business is just dealing with regulators. And so, you know, we know if you put
out an AI, it's definitely going to say offensive things. And so I think they were kind of terrified
of that. And so even internally, uh, when they were developing, um, you know, there was a version of
a chatbot that Noam had built. Um, and this is the one that that sort of whistleblower claimed was
conscious. That I think they called it LaMDA. Um, it actually originally had a different name, but
he was forced. They were forced to change the name because the original name was human. So they
weren't even allowed to give it a human name. So the original name was something human and it had to
be changed to LaMDA. Um, but even inside of the company, you know, there were restrictions on what
you could put out. They had a version of Dolly called Image Gen, and it was prohibited from making
human forms. So even internally the researchers weren't allowed to generate images of humans. So
they were just extremely risk averse, I think, is the answer.

Host: And how do you think it would have been different if Sergey and Larry were still in charge and
pushing forward?

Paul Buchheit: I mean, I think they can override, you know, risk aversion, right? But it takes
someone with that level of credibility to really bet the company or to stay, yeah, we're going to do
this thing, and it's going to cause a lot of problems. Um, but I think that if given the chance,
Google never would have launched AI. The only reason they launched it is because OpenAI, you know,
put out ChatGPT. And suddenly it became a thing that they were forced to do. And that also helped
them too, because, you know, OpenAI took a lot of those bullets in terms of like saying crazy and
offensive things. Um, and so at that point, then, uh, you know, Google could put out something that
was a more sanitized version that, you know, prohibits the existence of white people or whatever.

Host: But um, you know, OpenAI kind of spun out of YC, and you were around at that time. Originally
it was YC Research, right?

Paul Buchheit: So, you know, again, kind of going back to the early teens, we were just tracking the
progress of this technology, and that was where we started to see deep learning doing really kind of
impressive things where there's, like, playing video games and like winning and getting good at
things where you could say, where you could finally see that AI was real, right? So for decades, AI
was kind of the sci-fi thing, and you had all the symbolic AI, which I would say is kind of like
garbage. And so finally, AI was doing something that was like truly impressive. Um, so, you know, it
was kind of on our radar. And then, you know, Sam, I think, talks to just a lot of people. And so he
had, uh, I think, been at one of these things where Elon was essentially ringing the alarm bell
saying AI was going to kill us all and proposing that, um, maybe there should be regulation. And so
we're having these discussions. You know, Sam's asking, like, "Do you think we should push for AI
regulation?" And, um, yeah, I'm of the opinion that that only makes things worse because I don't
have great confidence in our elected representatives to be, you know, super wise and forward-
thinking. And so my argument was that the better thing to do would be that we actually build the AI,
and, um, you know, that way we're able to influence the direction that it goes. Um, but AI was still
at that time something that we didn't really know what the time frame would be to be able to have
revenue because it was still basically a research project. And it requires just massive amounts of
capital because the researchers are pretty highly paid.

Host: Roughly what year was this?

Paul Buchheit: I think this was about 2015. I think this was about the time after Google did the
DeepMind acquisition as well, right?

Host: Yes. This was after DeepMind, which made this issue more complicated because we didn't,
perhaps in those conversations, there was a desire that we wouldn't want this AI to be stuck at
Google, right?

Paul Buchheit: Exactly. So the fear is that basically this gets developed all locked up inside of
Google. Um, and so the idea was that we wanted this to be something, you know, more open to the
world, open to our startup ecosystem. Um, and so the idea was that, you know, we had this concept of
YC Research, that we would, um, find some way to fund this, and then hopefully, you know, our
startups would be able to benefit from and build on top of that, which, you know, has in fact
happened, of course. Like, half our startups now are building on top of it.

Host: What are your thoughts on now, uh, open source models?

Paul Buchheit: So I'm totally in favor of them. So I, I, I think like, when we think about what is
the long-term trajectory of AI, it's the most powerful technology we've ever invented. Um, and so
the question is like, where does that power go? And I think there's essentially two directions. You
either go towards centralization where all the power gets, you know, centralized in the government
or in a small number.

Paul Buchheit: ...of like big tech companies or something like that, and my feeling is that that's
catastrophic for the human species. Because you essentially minimize the agency and power of the
individual. And I think the opposite direction is towards freedom. And as much as possible, we
should give this power and these capabilities to every individual to be kind of the best version of
themselves. So you can think about that in terms of, you know, how much—what would it look like if
everyone had a 200 IQ or whatever, right? Like, instead of just having all of that power
concentrated in one place.

Paul Buchheit: And open source is very important because it's kind of a litmus test for that, right?
Because it's true freedom. It's freedom of speech. It's First Amendment, right? And if you don't
have that, if your models are all locked away under some sort of lockdown system where there's a lot
of rules about what can be said, what kinds of thoughts are acceptable, then we essentially lose all
freedom right there. Freedom of speech is meaningless if I don't have the freedom of thought to even
compose the ideas that I'm going to communicate.

Paul Buchheit: Going back to the history of OpenAI, like the real story of how OpenAI got
started—it's actually not well known. You know, like many companies, the founding story as it gets
retold and retold becomes sort of sanitized for public consumption. But you had a front row. In
fact, you interviewed many of the early researchers that became essentially the people who built
OpenAI. Like, what is the—like, can you tell us the real founding story?

Host: Sure. Why—I wouldn't say many. I interviewed Ilya. So, yeah, I mean, it goes back to again
these discussions of like, okay, maybe the way forward instead of trying to outlaw AI is actually
that we should build it, and as much as possible in the public interest. And so Sam, you know, is
just an incredible organizer. Never met someone who's able to bring together so many different
interests and so many different people. And so he was able to round up, you know, essentially
donations from Elon and a number of other people. I know PG and Jessica also contributed to the
original OpenAI nonprofit. I think we even kicked in some YC value. We did. And so that was kind of
the root of it.

Host: And then he recruited the original team, you know, Greg and Ilya, and basically got the whole
thing started. And he was still running YC at the time. And originally, this was like a subsidiary
of YC called YC Research, right? So the original concept, I think, was that it was actually going to
be part of this thing that we were calling YC Research. And then I think, kind of like as Elon got
more involved, it became its own thing—OpenAI—with kind of Elon more of the face of it. And no one
really even knew about the YC roots.

Host: Actually, if you go back and look, as part of their most recent lawsuit, they published some
of the emails. And there's the one where Elon is like, "Get rid of the YC stuff." Why do you think
OpenAI worked?

Paul Buchheit: Like, I remember in the early 2000s looking at Google and being like, "That's the
company that's going to invent AGI someday." And then the way it played out is not the way I would
have predicted. Again, the idea with OpenAI and part of the lure—like, the pitch to researchers was
that when you come here, your stuff's not going to be locked away. We're going to put it out in the
world, right? And so researchers, you know, are motivated by that and motivated by the mission of
making this something that isn't just locked up inside of Google.

Paul Buchheit: And so I think that attracted a lot of talent. And it's the same thing, you know, as
with a startup. Do you want to be inside of a large corporation where—again, Google—the researchers
working at Google couldn't even make a version of image gen that would generate human form, right?
So they're just so locked down internally that if you're a person who likes to ship and likes to
move fast, you know, OpenAI was the startup version of AI. But yeah, I think if Google were in top
form, there there is no way that it would have worked. And that's often the way it is with startups,
right? Like, if you were facing an actual formidable competitor, you don't have a chance. The reason
startups work a lot of times is because you're competing with a slow company—you know, big companies
that have the wrong incentives internally.

Host: Do you think OpenAI in 2016 was comparable to Google in 1999 when you joined it?

Paul Buchheit: I would say it's actually more of a crazy long shot. Like, it really seemed—and
again, if you look at these emails that got released as part of the lawsuit, there's like one from
Elon where he's like, "You guys have a zero percent chance of success," right? Like, and it really
looked like that. And so it was far from obvious that it was going to be successful. I think that
the place, and for a long time it really wasn't. You know, they were still doing like video games
and everything. And it was really actually like the LLMs that made the big difference, right?

Paul Buchheit: So like, GPT-2 was kind of—I remember Sam just being really excited, wanting to show
me this thing, you know, where it like predicts the next word. And next word prediction is such a
deceptively simple thing that you still hear people dismissing it like, "Oh, it's not really
intelligent. It's just predicting the next word." But it's like, you know, you try predicting the
next word. It's not that easy.

Paul Buchheit: And in fact, if you think about it, if you can predict the next word, you can predict
anything, right? That's what a prompt is, right? You say like, whatever the thing is you want
predicted, that's your prompt, and then the next word is the prediction, right? And so in order to
do next word prediction and be able to do what it does, it necessarily has to be building some sort
of model of reality or of, you know, its perception of reality, which in this case is limited by the
fact that it's just being fed text, which is a sort of strange thing to grow up on.

Host: On the like control versus freedom thing, we're sort of betting on open source to give us
freedom. Zuck sort of interestingly become like the hero of open source. And like, on the one hand,
I feel like you could argue it's accidental—like, the weights were released unofficially and he only
had the GPUs because they were trying to compete with the TikTok algorithm. You've worked with him.
Like, is it sort of accidental, or is he like just the kind of guy that's always going to be at the
center of everything big that happens in the world?

Paul Buchheit: It's a good question. I mean, I don't know the backstory on that. He's definitely
like a smart guy. Like, I wouldn't underestimate him. And obviously, there's like an opportunistic
element, right? Because they're kind of behind in many ways, right? And so it's a way for them to
differentiate, a way for them to sort of weaken their competitors. So there is, but there's nothing
wrong with that. I mean, the fact that it's good for them is a great thing. But should we be worried
that we're relying on Meta to keep open source forward when he's a fairly strategic guy?

Paul Buchheit: Oh, yeah, we shouldn't exclusively rely on them. I think we should be grateful that
they're on the right side, but we can't count on them being the only ones. Like, I think we have to
build a whole coalition of people who are in favor of freedom and open source, and not just sort of
bet everything on Facebook saving us.

Gary Tan: Well, I guess to build on Harj's question: Meta is not making money on this. They're
funneling profits from their gigantic advertising monopoly and just using that to build open source
AI models for reasons, but not to like make money.

Paul Buchheit: They'll make money. Like, so I mean, they're using the models internally as well,
right? So the—and there's a lot of interesting stuff you can do with these models in terms of
improving ad targeting, recommendations, like all the things that are driving their business are
going to be improved by those algorithms. And of course, it's also an opportunity, you know? They
exist in this competitive ecosystem versus Facebook—I mean, versus Google and Apple—who are, you
know, are both rivals in various ways. And so they're all kind of competing with each other. So
their ability to kind of undercut competitors is also an important thing.

Host: But you were saying like specifically Facebook's not making money off open source as a
strategy.

Paul Buchheit: Well, I guess it's just like they seem to be in a fairly unique position to do this.
If Zuck changes his mind and stops open sourcing, how else will we get large open source models if
they cost like a billion dollars to train, right? And it's not clear how you make a billion dollars
off that.

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I think that's an unanswered question. I mean, that is like one of the
fundamental concerns I have, which is that I think because it's so expensive to build these models,
yeah, it is—that is like an inherently centralizing thing. Where if you need a trillion dollar
cluster to build your AGI, it's hard to do that. But at the very least, to the extent that we can
have like the legislative groundwork that says we have the right to do that, and then, you know, we
also have a lot of startups that are working on ways to make all of this more efficient.

Paul Buchheit: So, you know, right now it costs that much, but we're also developing new hardware
that's going to be able to do these things perhaps orders of magnitude more efficient. Like, right
now I would say our algorithms are probably not that great. I would be willing to bet that in 10
years the actual fundamental learning algorithms are going to be way better and hopefully more
efficient. So we'll have both better hardware and better algorithms.

Host: It seems like that if you just think about the amount of computational power to train a human
versus the computational power to train like GPT-4, like we're evidently much more efficient.

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I think there's still a lot. I think there's still just a lot of inefficiency.
The human brain runs on like 15 watts or something around that.

Gary Tan: Can you share some of the stuff that you know about reasons why Zuck might be incentivized
to keep funneling money into open source?

Host: I mean, this is wild speculation on my part, but I think that, you know, the next generation
of LLMs ostensibly maybe only costs a billion dollars. If you look at how much Meta—like, Meta
literally changed their name to Meta because they were trying to, you know, sort of create the
metaverse—and that, you know, depending on what estimate you use from external sources, like 20 to
50 billion dollars, like many multiples of the Apollo project. So I think a billion is not a lot.

Host: And then when you see things like OpenAI or Anthropic that have these incredible frontier
models, I think it's smart for Meta to consider: "Can we deflate the gross margins of these
companies?" And so releasing an open source model and then allowing you to run it on your own pure
hardware, on your own metal, that's probably the most deflationary thing you could do. You can, you
know, if a frontier model 405B gets you to like 90ish to 98 percent of the performance of the best
frontier model you can get behind a closed API, you could probably just like evaporate billions of
dollars in pure gross margin that would then be used in R&D.

Host: And so, you know, I think it's incredibly smart, you know, sort of seeing around the corner,
trying to prevent new competitors to Meta. It's not that far off, like Google releasing Gmail for
free and just giving the storage away. It's like Google had another way to make lots of money, and
so they could just release free services. Facebook has other ways to make money, and so they can
just like release open source AI and make sure that no one else has like a unique lead.

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, and I would imagine it helps with recruiting too. I mean, if I were an AI
researcher and it was kind of a tossup between, you know, Meta and another, and a closed source, I
would definitely go with the open company.

Host: I mean, to refund what you were saying, Gary—is with the change to Meta, if we really just
have more arms-race kind of speculation about Meta—if they really want to make this metaverse
future, building artificial intelligence, AGI is just a building block. And this building of LLMs
and building a fair lab, which is like a component to get it out—because Meta is very serious about
that. They just announced today they spent a couple billion dollars. Again, not just for models, but
to buy a large stake in Luxottica, who is this major brand that owns a lot of the eyeglasses in the
world. It's the Meta glasses. Because the Ray-Ban apparently, the last release that they had,
actually sold in two months more than they ever done in the previous generations.

Paul Buchheit: Oh yeah, people love these things.

Host: So if we speculate and we just play a direct line, could be that Zuck is very, very serious
about making the metaverse happen, and AI it is a component to get AR/VR working. Because in order
to augment the digital world, you really need to understand it. Language is one part, vision is one
part. So this is all a building block. So a billion there—it's just like, yeah.

Gary Tan: I will say that I'm not that impressed with Meta's consumer execution of, you know, just
dropping AI into the product. Like, recently, you know, I've been using the Facebook blue app for I
don't know how long since it came out. And, you know, I wanted to just get photos of, you know,
things that happened five, ten years ago, you know? When was the last time I went here? Who are my
friends? These are sort of the most obvious things that, you know, if you use Facebook, you sort of
want these. But, you know, they drop in 70B and I think in some localities you can get access to
405B literally in both facebook.com and WhatsApp. But there's no, you know, there's no RAG on the
stuff that, you know, is about me. So it seems like kind of like an obvious own goal.

Host: On the other hand, like, seemingly that stuff is pretty expensive, which is sort of the plight
of anyone working on consumer using these frontier models.

Gary Tan: I do wonder whether the Blue app has been kind of more deprecation because actually the AI
on Instagram is actually a lot better than the one on the Blue app. I kind of been playing with a
bit to plan my trip when I was in Japan and it got me a lot of pictures and places.

Host: Oh, I didn't realize you use the—

Gary Tan: Yeah, we been playing with a couple of them. I also use Perplexity.

Host: Yeah, I like Perplexity is better than the Instagram one, but pictures are nice. So looking
forwards, what do you think are some of the ways this is going to break over the next few years?
Which is, how is AI going to... and one thing we haven't talked about here, because we're kind of in
the trenches of just helping the startups in the batch—is, are we trending towards AGI? And just
like, all the laws of everything we know go to the world over? Will there be startups? Will there be
money? Will there be humans? Will money still exist?

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I mean, we don't know. That's that's again one of the funny questions of OpenAI
since it's all funded with these sort of post-AGI—I, it's like, we'll pay you back once AGI happens.

Paul Buchheit: you're like will we still have money maybe it could happen. Um, yeah I mean I think
just honestly we don't really know.

Host: Are you a believer that we are definitely going to get to AGI?

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I think we're on the path. I think the key point that happened is we crossed
the line where AI went from a research project where you kind of put in a lot of money and don't
really get much out to a thing where you put in money and then you get out more. And so it's like
when a reaction, you know, like a plutonium reaction, right? Goes critical. If you have plutonium
spheres and they're kind of warm and then you put them together and then it explodes. Or when
DARPANET became the internet moment, right? The internet crossed that point in the '90s, in the
mid-'90s, where all of a sudden more investment produces more impressive outcomes, which leads to
more investment. And that's where we are right now where people can't seem to throw money at it fast
enough, right? And we're actually talking about it being a national issue where we need to build and
increase our electric supply to train the AI, right? It's become a national security thing. And so I
think once that happens, you get that cycle and it just keeps growing, right? We just keep investing
more and that just keeps making the AI better. And it's clearly solving a lot of problems, and we
know this because we have all the companies that are out there building it. And so I think it just
keeps improving.

Host: Why is that not unanimously the view among smart people? Like, why? There's Yann LeCun at Meta
who's constantly arguing that this is not the path to AGI, and he's a pretty smart domain expert.

Paul Buchheit: I don't know. That's a question for him, you know? I like a lot of what he says
because he favors open source, but some of the other stuff he says I don't, I can't explain. I mean,
I do think that there's missing pieces, right? So it isn't like we have all of the parts of AGI. But
I think that it's kind of an incremental thing at this point where we keep kind of tacking on this
thing and that thing and it just keeps getting incrementally better. I think the one thing at
NeurIPS—this is the big AI academic conference where the attention paper that led to transformers
got published, like all the top research gets published—last year the top topics were things around
figuring out system one type of thinking, with Daniel Kahneman's framework. We're really good at
these things that are very planned, but not the high-level slower thinking that humans do with
system two. There's a lot of research that's kind of trying to figure out system two and system one
and trying to bridge the gap. Which when we unlock that, I think that's when we step forward to AGI.

Host: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's important to remember that right now when you're talking to
ChatGPT it's kind of just running stream of consciousness, right? And so what human could answer any
of these questions without stopping to think about it for a while? So one of the obvious next steps,
which people are working on, is like how do you give it time to think and kind of plan, consider
various options, explore ideas, just the same as a human would?

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, that's certainly what we're seeing in the companies themselves. They're
spending a lot of time on workflows, chain of thought, multi-agent systems. You know, you have
different steps. You know, what does a human do, and then they literally make a workflow like step
by step: read this paragraph, return one token from zero to nine relevance to the prompt. And then
you know, in aggregate, you make a metadata structure about that, drop that into the embedding, and
you know, have that be useful at the final generation step. Like it's literally a time and motion
study of what a human knowledge worker would do in different fields, which is exactly the type of
thing that happens in our thinking with system two. And all these founders that you're mentioning
are hardcoding the rules around this, but that I think we know is not the ultimate path to AGI.

Host: Just like these, it's a hack for now, right?

Paul Buchheit: Totally, a hack. Yeah. But over time, you know, as the system gets more intelligent,
it takes on more and more of that. My belief is that it all just comes down to patterns. And that's
part of why I believe in this generation of AI, because the neural nets are basically these huge
pattern recognition and generation engines. And that's what I think our own intelligence is too.

Host: Do we speculate a bit more on your views on the future? On this post that you had on Bluesky,
you had a very concrete example. There will be a future where we won't distinguish a knowledge
worker, right? So just kind of as a thought experiment of where this goes?

Paul Buchheit: My prediction there was that by 2033 you could take a lot of what is today's Zoom-
based worker. So someone who sits in front of a laptop with a camera and a keyboard and a mouse. And
the AI can basically watch that person do their job because it's all just virtual anyway. And then
pretty quickly learn their patterns and essentially deep fake that employee. So you could be in a
situation where you're in a Zoom call with someone and that person is actually an AI. Pretty clear,
right? We see all of these pieces coming together right now in terms of our ability to deep fake and
all of these different things. And I use that as an example not because that's necessarily how it's
going to play out, but that's a capability that we will have. And so for example, if you have one of
these Zoom-based jobs, I think within ten years most of those things could be transparently replaced
by an AI.

Host: Oh man, I mean we are on the path. I mean, all that data is already digital—your camera feed,
your audio, your input of the keyboard and mouse, and all of that. Probably there's a company
building that right now that's just recording all that data and building it.

Paul Buchheit: Yeah.

Host: The thin edge of the wedge on that community is r/antiwork. If you can make an AI agent that
deep fakes you and r/antiwork decides this is the thing, that's a billion-dollar company.

Paul Buchheit: I mean, the question is of course then, you know, what happens to all of those
people, right? And so I think that's the thing where we need to really start developing longer-term
visions of like, what is it that we're aiming for? Why are we building all this technology? And
again, for me that kind of goes back to this question of how is the power distributed, right? Is
this something that's all centralized control, or is it freedom where it enables everyone? Because I
think like in the lockdown scenario we very quickly get to the point where people are just saying,
well we don't even need all of these humans, right? And that also feeds into the same people who
want lockdown tend to be doomers who are wanting to lock down humans in a lot of other ways with you
central bank digital currency, all those kinds of limitations on individual freedom. And the
opposite direction, I think, is obviously what I favor, which is that we actually move towards
giving everyone greater agency. You think about all these tools like artistic tools. You know, when
a child is able to make their own animated series that's on the same quality as a Pixar movie or
something like that, that's actually really amazing. Think of all the stories that can be told and
all the creativity that enables.

Host: We'll just sit there and make adult robot games for each other.

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I mean, there's there's that. But again, I think one of the errors in the
central planning mindset is thinking that we can plan this all out and we can't. All we try to do is
move in the right direction and give people the right tools. And I think that as we enable everyone
to be smarter and everyone to make better decisions, then collectively we can move the whole world
in a better direction. But we're not smart enough, and I think it's a mistake to think that we are,
to actually be able to say, here's what the world's going to look like, and this is exactly how it's
all going to work. And that's how you end up with people locked up in their pods or whatever.

Host: Paul, another thing you've been thinking about a lot is geopolitics. As this AI stuff starts
to become real, how is that going to relate to geopolitics and the great power competition that
we're seeing now?

Paul Buchheit: This is part of the reason why we wanted to build it here, right? Is because if China
has the super AI, that's not going to be good for us. And in particular, wanting to keep it away
from these kinds of authoritarian systems of control, because the worst case scenario is that we
basically end up in permanent lockdown, right? Because AI can create a totalitarian system from
which escape is impossible. Because you know, even our thoughts are essentially being censored. And
you know, I think that's kind of like the disaster scenario for our species. And I think that if we
go down the path of control, humans basically end up as zoo animals. And I don't really want that.

Host: Yeah, one of the funnier things is you know, some of the legislation that's coming along to
try to control AI that we've been fighting, like S.B. 1047. They actually have certain statutes in
there. They've watered it down a little bit, but ultimately what they want to do is hold the model
builders in sort of personal liability or even criminal liability for the things that their models
might have a hand in doing. Which is sort of like throwing the car designer in jail because someone
got drunk and drove the car and hit someone, right? It's incredibly insidious.

Paul Buchheit: I think if you attach that kind of liability it becomes toxic, right? I'm not going
to want to touch something that has unlimited liability. And so necessarily that's a way for them to
exert essentially total control, right? If you impose that kind of liability on things, then no one
is going to want to go near it. And they are strongly incentivized to put really draconian
guardrails in place that again will limit our abilities in ways that you know we may not even think
about. But we've seen this very recently in recent history with the lockdown of social media. You
know, during COVID we had a global pandemic that ultimately killed tens of millions of people.
People were locked up in their homes, schools were closed, and we weren't allowed to talk about
where it came from. And I think that's a thing that we still don't fully appreciate how
catastrophically bad that is. If we can't make sense of the most important thing in the world, then
we can't make sense of anything.

Host: I guess the wild thing to spot is that like this is basically statism. And the wild thing is
I've heard stories of even China sort of doing that thing that is in S.B. 1047. I've heard that that
has actually happened to AI founders in China. They've literally been sort of disappeared and told,
"We will hold you personally accountable for the output of the LLM and models that your software
creates."

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, well, this is one of our great advantages: it's freedom. It's why we're ahead,
right? Because you can't build a model in that environment, you know? Because if you ask it about
Tiananmen Square or something like that, right, it has to lie to you. And actually, one of the
things I really like about xAI—they haven't really reached a great product yet, but they have a
great mission statement, right? To be maximally truth-seeking. And I think that's really important.
And an authoritarian regime is inherently truth-denying. And so they put themselves at a
disadvantage. And hopefully they keep themselves there.

Host: So it's up to us, then. We've got to get involved. We've actually got to fight for open source
AI and keep it open.

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, yeah. And fight to make sure that AI is a thing that increases individual
agency instead of eroding it.

Host: For people who are relatively neutral about being doomers or optimists, like, do you think
about what are the things that tip them in one direction versus the other?

Paul Buchheit: I do think some people are inherently kind of in one direction or another, right?
Because the doomer thing has been around for a long time. It isn't just now. You know, a lot of the
same doomer thing goes back to the '50s, '60s, or even much earlier than that. Industrial Revolution
writers in particular. You think about there was a very influential book, "Limits to Growth," from
the Club of Rome. Or something like that. There was a book published, "The Population Bomb," that
had everyone convinced that there was going to be mass famines in the '70s and '80s. And me, this is
something I grew up very aware of actually, because I was the fourth of five children born in the
'70s. And apparently people would give my mother nasty looks at the store, right? You're killing the
planet, you know, that kind of thing. Because people genuinely believed that we were all going to
have famines by now. And there's been a continual string of doom. And always the doomers are pushing
for central control. They're always on the side of control and lockdown. And so you know, if you
look at what did the Population Bomb advocate for? Mandatory sterilization. They want to lock people
down. And we still have that today where they're trying to lock down the food supply, trying to lock
down the flow of information. You know, anything where they talk about combating misinformation, the
misinformation is anything that threatens the power of control, right? Because it always comes down
to control versus freedom ultimately. And growth. And so the doomers are degrowth, their lockdown,
their control versus your freedom, growth, and open source.

Host: We were talking a bit earlier about this. I had just watched this lecture from Richard
Hamming, who's a legendary scientist and mathematician who created lots of interesting things like
Hamming coding distance and all these things. He even won a Nobel Prize as well. And he has this
really cool lecture from like the early '90s or '80s. He's been writing about AI actually since way
way back. And he starts a lecture with saying that what's going to get in the way of AI progress is
going to be human ego, which like reminds me a lot of this thing of wanting to control it. And
what's going to get in the way is really that, which still like applies now.

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a lot of ego always in the way. I think Y Combinator
has a huge role to play. Well, just like the startup community broadly, because I just feel like the
more cool tools there are that show everyone how awesome AI can be, the more inspiring that vision
is.

Host: Yeah, absolutely. And again, I think that was part of what's so important about the launch of
ChatGPT. Like, even if I would say even if OpenAI just vanishes tomorrow, I think they've achieved
the most important part of their mission, which

Host: Was is really bringing this out to public awareness, and that now we have, you know, all of
these people working and all these people thinking about it. It isn't something that's like locked
away, you know, inside of Google or inside of—you know, the doomers are like this needs to be done
in a secret government laboratory. That's how you get Skynet. Skynet is when you build it in a
secret government laboratory. You know, I think developing in the open and across, you know, a wide
variety of perspectives and everyone working on it is our best shot at the optimistic outcome.

Paul Buchheit: Yeah, these are not theoretical things by the way. I mean, there is some evidence
already that giant corporations like United Healthcare Group are already blocking, you know, the use
of AI calls just to get claims, um, cleared, for instance, and that's very much in their interest.
They detect AI, they decide they're not going to talk to that thing. And then on the flip side, you
could also—it's purely adversarial—like on the flip side, you can imagine drowning human beings in
like infinite phone trees that, legally speaking, are, you know, completely rock solid, but you will
never get your claim reimbursed.

Host: Yeah, and um, that's really sort of the most extreme, um, Kafkaesque sort of situation that I
have in my head. Like, we don't want the best frontier models in one or two giant corporations
locked away behind, you know, sort of this corporate morass that is, you know, basically paperclip
maximizing of its own.

Paul Buchheit: That's a really—I thought that example—it's because it's totally the wrong thing for
United Health. Like, what they should be doing is like developing their own, like AI voice thing
that's better at convincing the other one that, like, the claim, like, shouldn't be purchased or
something, right?

Host: Yeah, and by default, if we have this sort of status that locks everything down, that
safest—then, you know, guess what's going to happen? United Healthcare Group is the only one that
should be entrusted with the frontier 200 IQ model because it is, you know, right there alongside
the state.

Paul Buchheit: Right, right. Inevitably, you know, power concentrates. And part of, I think, what's
great about Y Combinator as an organization is that we're about empowering all of these individuals,
you know, where we find some 19-year-old kid and like help them build something. You know, I mean,
like Sam himself was like one of the original 19-year-olds, right? So he's this random 19-year-old
that PG picks out, crowd, right? Sort of definitionally, like if you're, you know, 20-some and you
know how to code and you want to build things for people, like there's just another option. Like you
don't have to go and work for Microsoft.

Host: Yeah, absolutely, and and again, this is one of the great things about AI is that your ability
to do those things is increasing. I think we're going to see, you know, very successful startups
that actually don't even require a massive team anymore. And that was part of, you know, what really
has enabled—and again, the original concept behind the founding of YC was because of technology. It
is now possible for like a couple of kids to start a real company. Um, and that trend has only
accelerated. Well, I feel like that was one of the best episodes we've done so far, and uh, PB,
thank you so much for joining us. Uh, we hope to have you back many, many more times.

Paul Buchheit: Thanks, Gary.

Host: That's it for this time. Catch you next time.
