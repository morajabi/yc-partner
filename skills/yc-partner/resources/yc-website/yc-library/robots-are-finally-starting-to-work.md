## Transcript

Kwan Wang: The equation I think for starting a robotic business has changed and will continue to
change at an accelerating pace because the upfront cost is not that high anymore.

Host: Everyone's sort of spending a lot of time in the digital world and it feels like you know now
is the time to start thinking about the world of atoms.

Co-host: You literally just gave people the playbook for how to build a vertical robotics company.

Kwan Wang: This has really been our mission from the start is to create that Cumbrian explosion.

Co-host: It still like blows my mind. I didn't know if this would exist even in my entire lifetime.

Host: Welcome back to another episode of The Lightcone. Today we have a very special guest, Kwan
Wang. He's one of the co-founders of Physical Intelligence, which we think might be the robotics AI
lab that brings about the GPT one moment for all of robotics. Kwan, thank you for joining us.

Kwan Wang: Pleasure to be here, has been a longtime admirer of YC. And our mission is to build a
model that can control any robot, to do any task that it's physically capable of, and to do so at
such a high level of performance that's going to be useful to people in all walks of life. And so
GPT-1 for robotics, you know, what is it? You know, is the Chat GPT moment for robotics real? Our
perspective here is that um we want to build a model that's really intelligent. We want to build a
platform that allows us to externalize that intelligence to the rest of the world and allow them to
use it to build very interesting application in all sorts of vertical and robotics. And we we think
that it's gonna be More like a peeling and audience analogy where you start from a really strong
base model that have all sorts of common sense knowledge and already works to some extent on your
robot. Um you have then a mixed autonomy system, uh very similar, for example, to an autonomous
driving car today. Um and then you actually deploy the system to do a real job. That system might
make a mistake. Um it's okay. Um and then over time by actually exposing the system to the
complexity and the edge case of the real world, that system gets incrementally, even just slightly
better, over time every day. Um and you know, one day you wake up and you suddenly have a system
that is just fully autonomous and just provide tremendous value. Might be helpful to give the
audience a bit of a mini history lesson on why robotics is so hard. And there's been a lot of
breakthroughs in the last two years. And I mean, just to simplify the robotics problem is three
pillars. Semantics, which I think we got a lot of unlocks and with language models that somehow we
ported into robotics. Then you have the planning. And then the last thing is control, which needs to
be done in real time and interact with a environment that changes. Walk us through the seminal
papers that a lot of the team of Pi Robotics published that gave you the inkling that the GPT one
moment is near. And that started in 2024. Yeah. So the dream to build general purpose robot like
robots has been a long time dream, I I think, in humanity. Like, you know, we're not the first to
say that our mission is to build a model that can work on any robot. Um and we're really fortunate
to be in this moment in time in history where we feel that it's possible to kind of walk back a
little bit. Um a few years before there was I think the first is SayCan, which to me was the first
demonstration of language model and how you can bring all of the common sense knowledge in language
model into robotics and therefore that significantly kind of um reduces the need to collect robot
specific data. So for example, if you have a task of, oh, I want to go to the YC office to record a
podcast, you know, what are the steps I need to take, you can ask a language model, you know, just
show me the steps and show me the plan. And that worked incredibly well. And then the way kind of
language model infiltrate, if you will, in robotic is it start at the planning level uh at the
semantic level. And then but that's still the control problem. You know, at the end of the day, you
still need a mechanism to convert the plan into low-level action that can actually actuate the
robot. And that brings us to POME and that brings us to RT2, which stands for robotic transformer
two. And what this two work really show is that if you start from a vision language model that is
really powerful and you kind of use robotic data to Adapt this model to speak robot language, if you
will, um, then you see a lot of transfer from the kind of knowledge that exists in the language
model in the vision language model down to the low-level action. Like um, one of my favorite
examples when we did the RT2 project was you can have a picture of celebrity on the table. If you
have a picture of Taylor Swift, you have a picture of the Queen of England, and you can ask the
robot, you know, pick up the cocaine and move it to Taylor Swift, even though the concept of Taylor
Swift is just doesn't compl exist in the robot data at all and that work. You can do other examples
such as um kind of spatial reasoning that doesn't exist in the robotic data at all. Like for
example, move the dinosaurs next to the red like red car. And these are like all just completely
unseen objects in robot data. And so that was RT2 and that was POME. Now, RT2 and Palm E are single
embodiment um exercise. Just for the audience, single embodiment meaning it worked for a very
specific robot. It worked for a very specific robot. In robotic, you can ask the question, how do
you scale? Um, especially how do you scale data collections? And one of the insights that we had
back then was, you know, maybe the data from one robot is not that different from another robot's
anyway. Like if you have enough robots in your training data, maybe what the model learn isn't to
control one specific robot. The m what the model learn is something that's more abstract, which is
how do I kind of learn a general notion of what it means to control any particular robotic platform.
And therefore I would be better at controlling any particular platform. And that brings us to what
we call uh Open X-Embodiment and robotic transformer X. That was a big paper because it was the
first that showed potential scaling laws that applied to robotics because now you could start
training all these models across multiple kinds of hardware, not just one, which has never been done
in robotics ever before. Because from all the research labs I would all train with a very specific
set of sensor actuators and motors and it was all very finicky with that particular hardware, right?
Yeah. One of the really interesting results from um Open X-Embodiment and let me provide the context
here is that you can take, let's say, ten different robot platform, collect data from them, train a
policy and really optimize the policy to work well on that platform. Um so let's say, you know, you
have that, you have ten different platform, ten different policies. And now if you simply take the
data and absorb it into a model that is high capacity enough to really absorb that data and you can
compare. Like you have this generalist, right, that learned to control how the ten the ten different
robot, you can compare it to the specialist that has been optimized to work well on a particular
embodiment, how does it compare? And the the it interesting result from OpenX is it was fifty
percent better. Wow. Um and that was really surprising. Because in robotic it's hard enough to get
your model to work on one particular robot platform. And one of the reasons why I say that we're
really fortunate to be in this moment in time in robotic is because OpenX was really only possible
because of the support that we received from the robotic community. It was a huge collaboration
across the robotic community. And the the the reason why that's really important is there is this
joke in like robotic grad school that, you know, if you wanna add two years to your PhD, just work
on any robot platform. You know, by that logic, if you wanna have ten robot platform, that's twenty
years. Like why

speaker_1: is that it takes like a year or two to just get the platform um up and running to d even
collect the data?

Kwan Wang: Yeah. Is it fair to say that the data set that was created from Embodiment X is similar
to the scale of an impact that Image Net did for Vision because it was huge and it was the first
large data set across multiple hardware, huge collaboration and I still think that ImageNet was more
impactful in the vision community. And the reason for that is um a few. The first is that ImageNet
also allowed for reproducible evaluation. Right. Um, you know, OpenX as an effort was more about
making data available for kind of people to use. And evaluation is a really difficult problems um in
robotic that OpenX did not solve. Um and the second is I think OpenX is a drop in the bucket at this
point in the robotic community. Um if you measure in the kind of the scale and the volume and the
diversity of data that the community is collecting, I think OpenX at this point is a drop in the
bucket.

Host: I mean I guess we started talking about sort of GP1, but even GP1, you know, that was sort of
this moment where you can prove your Alec Radford figured out that there was a neuron based on a
very specific input and output. Um and then that allowed the scaling laws to sort of take hold. The
biggest problem in robotics I've heard is basically actually exactly what we've been talking about.
It's like it's the data problem. You know, uh language you could bootstrap off of like, you know,
the sum total of what you could get off the internet, which is actually quite a lot. Can you give us
like a sense for um like scale? Is it like petabytes? Like, you know, what do you think is necessary
as an input to, you know, the true GPT one of robotics?

Kwan Wang: Yeah. So the data scarcity problem in robotic, there's a few ways to look at it. The
first way is that it's really two problems in disguise. There is the generation, data generation
problem, and there's data capture problem. And the difference is that the data capture is that there
might already be lots of robotic data that is being generated, but there's just never been really an
incentive to capture it, to make it easy for digestions in training. Um and that's one of the goal
that OpenX was trying to solve, which is if you have robotic data, it's a really good idea to
capture it and make it possible to train on. The second way to look at it is that robotic is very
different from language model. There is not a internet of robotic data that you can use. And so you
see these kind of very operationally heavy effort to collect data. And there's the question of is it
going to scale? Well, the way that I look at it is let's take the US GDP, 24 trillion US dollars.
Let's say if we actually solve robotics, a model that can control any robot to do any tasks. Napkin
math maybe contribute ten percent to ro US GDP. Well that's already a massive number. Um and I I
think that promise is one of the reasons that warrants the investment into data collections um in
robotics. And the third way to look at it is we're very focused on cross-embodiment. And cross-
embodiment, there is the data collection aspect of as well, which is to really make sure that your
model and your organizations and infrastructure are set up to consume data from many different
sources of r uh of robots. And that actually allowed you to scale easier. For example, I if I were
to contrast our approach compared to let's say a company that have a particular hardware platform
that they optimize for and they scale, um it it's not an approach that have really allowed people to
scale um because It's just much harder to figure out how do you manufacture like a thousand unit of
something for now compared to making sure that you yourself are ready to absorb data from like a
thousand different types of robot that are already in there i in the community.

Host: I mean, it's a crazy problem, isn't it? I mean, the hardware itself, even within the same
design of embodiment, if there's a hardware run that goes awry or like one of the servos is slightly
different, like you see it in the data, right? And then how do you control for that?

Kwan Wang: Yeah, so I think we were doing kind of like an inventory of robot in the company and we
were so shocked to find that there are no robot no two robot platforms that are the same. And if you
ask people in the royal community, sometimes there's debate about multi-robot versus single robot.
And the argument is that you know single robot is simpler to scale. And actually that's not how it
plays out in practice. Like how it plays out in practice is even if you have a single robot that
you're optimizing for. over time that platform is gonna drift. You know, maybe you wanna make
hardware change or you have software change. You end up in a situation where it's much harder for
you to reuse old data because, you know, in machine learning, if you want to generalize from a
distribution, you would like many sample from that distribution. And if you just have one robot
platform that have a major change every three months, maybe you have a few data points from that
distribution. Um whereas if you start from the hypothesis that if you have many robot platforms in
your fleet, your model is gonna learn something more abstract, which is how do I control a robot,
not any particular robot? Then the model will be able to ingest data from, you know, a slightly
different robot barrier. And actually we're starting to see emergent property. in this kind of robot
l large probation model. That's

Host: good news.

Kwan Wang: Where you start to see like interesting transfer b b between different um data sources.
For example, today it's possible to perform tasks zero shot. Zero shot meaning you don't collect any
data. And these are the tasks that last year might have required like hundreds and hundreds of
hours.

Host: What are some examples? Yeah, do we have any videos we can see that like show? So, you

Kwan Wang: know, um I get might get some flack when I come back because this is not published
result. Hopefully this will come out soon. Um so you know, I want to reserve the excitement for that
and I'm kinda like building up the the the the the excitement a little bit. Um so hopefully this
will come out soon. All right. These these are not simple tasks. These are like actually difficult
tasks that just last year require like hundreds of hours of data collections.

Host: You hear here on Lightcone First that there's some emergent properties that are gonna come out
of Pi. Can you give

Kwan Wang: us a sense of like the flavor of the tasks? It's really easy to fool yourself. And so we
wanted to test across like few different tasks of different flavor. Like tasks that require
precision, task that require reasoning with multiple objects in the scene. It all seems to have this
property. Um that's really nice. So it it does seem like that's something that's kind of a more
general property that emerged rather than we just, you know, got lucky and suddenly the model
started working on one particular task.

Co-host: Could you help us understand where we are now in terms of like what's working and how well
it's working? Like we're not quite at the Chat GBT moment yet. Like, where are we? And I think you
brought some videos that you were going to show us to like help everybody visualize what the current
state of the art actually looks like.

Kwan Wang: I think where we are is I think if you have a task where it's okay for the robot to make
a mistake, um and it's possible for you to set up a mixed autonomy system where you have a person
that takes over when the robot makes a mistake and provide corrections. It is possible to get to a
level of performance where it starts to make sense to think about scaling robot deployment. And the
example that I specifically want to highlight here is this blog post that we did with Weave and
Ultra. And you know it's great that these are also both YC company. I want to provide a little bit
of context here first. The context is that Pi is a primarily research organization. We want to focus
on building the best model. Um but we also want to not be tunnel vision. We want to make sure that
the model that we built actually gonna be useful and actually perform tasks that people in society
care about. And one of the really good ways for us to do so is to partner really closely with
companies that want to get robot out there today. And the way that these relationships work is that
we treat each other like we're on the same team. Very free flow of information. Um and we design a
system that try to get the best possible performance for the tasks that these companies care about.
So let me talk about we first. What you're seeing in this video is a system that we built together
folding really diverse items of laundry in a real laundromat in the mission. You can see you know
people walking outside. And why this task is difficult is because there's just infinite possibility
of observation space. Like you know Um clotings are deformable. And no two item of clothing here are
the same. And these are also unseen. You know, these are not like clothing items that are seen in
the training data.

Host: Yeah, I love this team. They are some of the most cracked people out of Apple I've ever met.
Garry

Co-host: was the partner for Weave, maybe I want to like explain like what Weave is and what they're
like what their like company is.

Host: Yeah, I mean they're actually try you know shipping their first robots into the home. Uh we
sort of talked about it as you know, being able to do household tasks like this. And I think they
were very inspired by physical intelligence's first demos with um with laundry folding. So it's
actually a total trip to hear about it, you know, a bit a year ago we were talking about them doing
it and then now to see them do it working in hand hand in hand with you is really awesome. I think
this is a great example of like you know, you need the model smarts, you need the data collection
and then the hardware and um the sort of system integration all working together is just hard to
nail. So

Kwan Wang: Yeah. And to get back to your question about why robotic is hard, it's really it's it is
a really hard system problem. Um like you need everything to work well and work well together to get
this result. And like we've is such an incredible team for us to to to work with to get this result.
And it actually didn't even take us that long to get this result. It was roughly where we set a goal
and maybe it was like two weeks afterwards where we got a model that was got a model and a system
that was good enough at performing this task. It still like

Co-host: blows my mind to see a robot actually folding laundry because I remember until basically
until Chat GPT, I didn't know if this would exist even in my entire lifetime. Because like folding
laundry, I mean it's that's always been like the Turing test for robotics because there's no way to
like deterministically program a system the way that you did like pre AI to do this 'cause the space
is like so infinite. And like we've shown that it's possible for us to do like basically everyone
can do this. Like robots will be able to do everything. It's only a matter of like improving it from
here.

Kwan Wang: There was a funny story where um when we first published Pi Zero, people thought of us as
the laundry company. Because the demo was just focused on laundry and actually picking home tasks,
especially tasks that has to do with deformable objects, it's a very intentional choice on our end.
We're not just after the home. We really want to make it broadly applicable. But picking home tasks
for us to start with has a few benefits. Like one is relatable. You know, you can see the laundry
folding demo and you can kind of like grok how this is gonna be useful and you can get a sense of
why it's hard. And the second is that it's really easy to set up to test generalization. You can
talk about uh Ultra, which is your company, Jared, a demo of it. Yeah, this is Ultra. The thing that
I love about this video is you see, you know, it's bright outside and you see this is four X speed
and it's uh hundred minutes. If I scroll to the end, the sun has set. Oh wow. That was one of the
big problems in robotics where it would be so sensitive to the environment in lighting and mess up
the vision system, the semantics and part of it. Yeah. And the interesting uh thing here is that it
is possible to get to the level of autonomy that the pro robot is just performing the task. This is
autonomy at scale. Like this is ready to be skilled.

Co-host: Juan, because this task is less familiar than laundry folding, do you wanna explain what
the robot is doing here and what Ultra is like doing as a company?

Kwan Wang: Ultra is a company that wanna makes it really easy to adapt robot to, you know, new
tasks. Um and right now they're focusing on logistics space, which is really important because you
know there's lots of labor shortage in logistics. And the task that we focus on together here is you
know, if you order an item from Amazon, you sometimes get this soft pouch that item gets shipped
from. And the task here is you have a tray of these items here and the robot is supposed to pick one
of them at a time. and place it inside this pouch. The machine would then close it and then pick up
the pouch and put it um on the left here to be ready for shipping. Now this heart is hard because
there are many different types of object that can be in this tray. And the opening here is actually
very narrow. So you see this interesting example of the robot kind of nudging the item to go into
the pouch. And that's that's really hard. Like that require very good understanding of the scene and
like very precise motion to nudge the object into the pouch. Um the other thing that's hard about
this task is the level of autonomy that's required. Like this is running for a entire day. There is
still human intervention, I wanna say, in um this like full day operation. Um but the level of
intervention is actually quite minimal.

Co-host: This is not just like some like demo station, right? This is actually recorded in an actual
e-commerce warehouse where they're actually shipping real products to real customers. This isn't
just like a like a lab. This

Kwan Wang: is packaging real customer uh real c order for customer to be shipped out in a real
warehouse. So this is real operations.

Co-host: So I think this is really cool because I I think when people think about robots, they tend
to think of the consumer use cases like weave, because that's, you know, what we're familiar with in
our daily life. What I find really interesting is that there's like a million applications like this
ultra thing that you wouldn't think of as obviously like, oh, who packs the like soft pouch of
things that you get from like Amazon? Well, there's some person like who does that and this is like
a job that we can now build a robot to do.

Kwan Wang: The interesting thing about the approach is that you're converting it from a very
difficult engineering problem into a operation problems of how do I identify the use case and how do
I collect the right data, which is in some sense more scalable because you can build the system that
allowed you to collect data for many different tasks. So you know is it's now a problem of how do I
scale data collection rather than, you know, for every new task, how do I design a really difficult
engineering system to solve it. YC Startup School is back. We're hand selecting the most promising
builders in the world and flying them out to San Francisco for July twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth to
discuss the cutting edge of tech. Apply now for a spot. Okay, back to the video. I think one thing
that the audience may not know is that you have a very unique technical insight that in the past
robotics folks would have kind of gasped and be shocked. Because robots need to run in real time. A
lot of times All of the compute runs in on device. But you guys have done something very different.
Can you tell us more about that? So that this works in in v in in real time with large models and
and really well? So the context here is that we know we talked to many companies that would like to
deploy robots and one of the first questions we get is what compute units should we get on the
robot? You know, it's expensive, it's gonna increase the bomb cost, and they're worried that it's
gonna go up in fashion very quickly because the model changes, the model gets bigger. How do I make
sure that the hardware that I'm gonna commit to today is gonna be viable for you know a couple of
years. It's very difficult questions. People are often really surprised when I tell them that almost
all of the robot evaluation that we run at Pi today, including the really complicated demo that we
have shown, making coffee, folding laundry, mobile robots navigating around. The model actually
hosted in the cloud. Um and you know this is not like a cloud isn't a server in the office. It's a
real cloud. The model is hosted in a data center somewhere. And within this high frequency control
loop that um is controlling the robot, the robot is actually querying an API endpoint that hosts the
model, sending it images and language command and getting back action that then execute directly on
the robot. And this is surprising because of precisely the reason that you mentioned, you know, how
do you actually make it work? This is why it's really important for Pi to couple system hardware and
model development and research like very tightly to together because like it allow us to solve for
this problem. So for example, one of the insight that we have here is that you can actually bury the
inference time within the robot control loop because you know if I'm a robot, I have enough action
for me to execute for the next hundred milliseconds. Like there's no reason for me to wait until I
finish executing that action to ask my model for a different action. I can do it as fast as um
inference, essentially. Um and so, you know, maybe when I only have 50 milliseconds of action worth
left, I can ask for the next sets of action. And when the current 50 milliseconds is over, like I
have something that's ready for me to continue with you know my next one hundred milliseconds. Um so
that's one of the inside the other uh kind of algorithmic improvement. Um we we refer to them as
real-time chunking. Design inference in such a way that you know there's gonna be a delay. in how
long it takes to query the model on the cloud, basically. Like the problem here, if I get uh a
little bit more technical, is an action chunk is a sequence of action that I can execute on the
robot. So, you know, it's not just one action. And if I have an action chunk that I can execute for
a hundred milliseconds and fifty milliseconds in, I wanna predict another action chunk and I'm gonna
transition to that new action chunk after my current fifty mill millisecond is over. How do I make
sure the two are consistent? Like you know, how do I make sure that if I'm moving this way, the next
action chunk is gonna continue me c to allow me to continue to be smoothly moving this way?

Host: You can pre compute. Yeah,

Kwan Wang: you can pre compute and like that's one of the algorithmic improvement that we've made to
make inference using model hosted in the cloud possible.

Host: I studied computer engineering, so I'm not really a an algorithms person, but when it comes to
systems like that, like pipelining, like get me all over that. That sounds great. That's so
interesting.

Kwan Wang: I mean this simplifies it's kinda is a brilliant choice because it simplifies so much of
the system for the robots. You don't need all these clunky, I don't know, people have two operating
systems at some time for for robots, embedded RTOs and then the regular one and all these complex
giant compute and power and this is what the initial versions of uh Waymo used to run basically a
server on the trunk. And you can't afford to do that with general day robotics, which is brilliant.
Then you figure out how to do it.

Host: Yeah, you don't have to. I mean you can do things some of it there obviously has to be some
compute there, but a lot of the compute can happen elsewhere and then Is there there must be a video
f like this this thing that we're looking at in the top left, like how much of that is sort of like
video feedback? How much of it is like local processed? I mean Yeah,

Co-host: is there any compute locally on this robot, or is it just like a dumb like video camera
that streams data to the cloud?

Kwan Wang: For this, I am not a hundred percent sure, but I am inclined to believe that it's just a
dumb computer. Like for this specific video, um I don't remember, but I'm just a hundred percent
confidence that we can make this work with a dumb computer and a robot. And the one other
interesting thing about our collaboration with Weaven Ultra is one, I've never seen their robot in
person. Oh wow. Um two is I have very little idea about how the robot actually works. Interesting.
Um and that's a very intentional choice. Like I wanna stay away from uh from that as far as
possible. I also don't know how they collect data. Like I intentionally don't ask them this question
to understand whether it's possible for an organization like Pi to parachute into their existing
system and to work really closely with them on the thing that actually matters to get the system to
work and not have to learn about how they've set up their system because in a way that's like a more
scalable recipe. Yeah, you completely decouple a lot of the hardware control loop choices from the
from the semantics and planning, which is just works. Just brilliant. Yeah, it I I mean I'm really
surprised. It works. Um when when we started the company, we thought that real deployment is gonna
be a con it's only gonna be in the conversation like five years um into the life of the company.
Because the problem is just really hard. And we're two years in and you know this is the result that
we we have and and real like deployment and scaling the r number of robots is A really serious
consideration today. And so the the pace of progress has just been very pleasantly much faster than
we expected originally. Often on

Co-host: this podcast we talk about like what all this means for startup founders. I I think that
might be an interesting question for us to explore here. So if you imagine someone was listening to
this podcast, maybe they're like a college student that's studying computer science and they think
robots are really cool and they want to do something like this. How should they get started and what
are the skills that they need? Do they need to be a mechanical engineer to be able to build a robot
like this? Can they just buy an off the shelf like robot arm and camera s system and like what

Host: high and high and you're off and running. Yeah. Yeah.

Kwan Wang: Before I actually answer your question, let me provide a few more contexts. The first is
that robotic is traditionally really hard because it's an extremely vertically integrated business.
You need to have your own customer relationship, your own hardware, your own autonomy stack, your
own safety certifications, your own everything. And the barrier to entry is just really high because
of that. And one of the things that we're trying to change is that we're trying to provide a
foundation of physical intelligence that the community can build on top of that allow them to
onboard autonomy onto their robot and their task much quicker than before. So that's the first, you
know, we want to provide that kind of seat of intelligence that allow people to move much faster so
that they can, you know, focus on other problems. Um the second thing is that The I think the recipe
for starting a vertical robotic business today is one, have a really good understanding of the
existing workflow because the robotic system needs to fit into existing workflow. And the second is
to be very meticulous about identifying where the opportunity is. You know, if There's a workflow
that needs X number of work today. You know, where is the robot when you insert it's gonna make the
biggest difference? And two is to really be scrappy when it comes to hardware and data collections.
You don't need a incredibly expensive robot that is capable of very precise motion today to be able
to do these tasks. And the reason why why is this why is this model really reactive and so they can
compensate for some of the inaccuracy in the actual robot movement and to ensure that you have the
ability to collect data and to run evaluation, especially evaluation in real deployment. The next
step after that is to get a mixed autonomous system that allow you to get to the point where it's
break even. Like break

Co-host: even economically.

Kwan Wang: Break even economically. Because the the reason why that's important is because it allows
you to then scale the number of robot. Because

Co-host: if you lose money on every robot it's very hard to scale.

Kwan Wang: That has been historically one of the biggest challenges for robotic companies that they
go into growth stage. It's just the payback cap peri is just doesn't make sense. Yeah, so the
equation I think for starting a robotic business um has changed and will continue to change at an
accelerating pace because the upfront cost is not that high anymore. And now, you know, what is the
upfront cost? The upfront cost is Much cheaper hardware, ability to collect data, ability to collect
um evaluation, and ability to kind of like understand the use case to see where they should insert
the robot. You know, it's not about having incredibly expensive hardware, it's not about having your
own proprietary, I think, autonomy classical uh stack anymore to be able to do this task. Um and so
it it allow company to focus on the component that will actually allow them to differentiate
themselves from the rest of the space.

Co-host: Now that you've sort of unbundled it and you no longer need to build this fully vertically
integrated company in order to build a robotics company, are we on the precipice of a Cambrian
explosion of vertical robotics companies where there's gonna be like a thousand companies like Ultra
going after, you know, every like menial job in the economy and like getting a deep understanding of
the customer, building a robot that can solve that problem, doing a like mixed human machine
deployment until it like can run fully autonomously and building a company in in every sector. Is
that is is that the future that you see people building on top of Pi?

Kwan Wang: It's funny that you mentioned Cambrian explosion because when we wrote this blog post
there was that term that was very kind of like hotly debated. We are, I think, academics at hurt and
we want to be kind of very major when we communicate. But, you know, myself personally, I believe
there's gonna be a Cambrian explosions of um robotic company across the entire world and across
many, many different vertical um just because it's just so much cheaper to build. And it doesn't
require um, you know, someone with twenty years of experience in robotic to start anymore. You know,
it require someone that is really scrappy, that can move really quickly, um, can do the system
integration, um, can understand customer what they want to start the deployment. I

Host: mean, what's coming up for me is obviously we work with a lot of robotics companies and to
meet a lot of founders and It feels like there's this continuum. Um, one is to use an analogy to
compute you know, personal computing. You could argue that industrial robotics today is basically
like mainframe or uh mini computer level. Like, you know, if you look back in the seventies, huge
public companies like digital computer that, you know, just did like these sort of very, very
expensive deployments, but like they were very, very specialized and it was all extreme enterprise.
Like, you know, the idea of a personal computer was ridiculous, right? You know, it took the Altair
and then Apple One and Apple Two and then IBM P C X T to like create personal computing. And then
like the traditional advice for robotics for many years is like go after like dirty and dangerous.
And then of course those are sort of the industrial cases. Like you, you know, you have these giant
Tesla robots in the Gigafactory and things like that. It feels like what you said around
profitability is really, really big. So you know, does that mean that the people who do the vertical
robot Cambrian explosion sort of moment uh the the people who are sort of first in that, like it
sounds like they would be the first to be profitable and not dirty and dangerous.

Kwan Wang: I think this is already happening today. I think um we have the fortune of having lots of
visibility into the robotic community because um, you know, people would like to talk to us, people
would like to learn, you know, what it's like to build a foundation model for robotic and people
would like to know how do I get the same level of autonomy. And there's so many companies and
businesses that we talk to that would love to put a robot into their space that, you know, it's okay
for the robot to make a mistake and they just need it so much. I really believe that res the the
recipe that I mentioned earlier of identify where the robot can fit in, focus on cheaper hardware,
collect data, run evaluation, mix autonomy, break even, scale robots will work across many different
verticals. And I'm I'm seeing it play out today and it's just incredibly exciting to see.

Co-host: And this is pretty cool that you literally just gave people the playbook for how to build a
vertical robotics company. Like this is a playbook that could possibly be followed successfully
hundreds or thousands of times.

Kwan Wang: And the reason why I want to mention it is because I I do wanna see that Cambrian
Cumbrian explosions and we wanna help enable it. You know, for Pi, if if we talk about why Pi is
going to fail, it's probably going to be because the problem is just way too hard. You know, maybe
it takes fifty more years to solve the robotic problem and you know, not couple of years, five ten.
Um and so we want to enable the community. We want to accelerate progress and that's why we're very
open. Like we publish our research. We open source Pi Zero and Pi O five. And people also shock when
they ask me, you know, is there any difference between Pi Zero and Pi O five that you open source
versus the model that we use internally Pi Zero and Pi O five? And the answer was actually no, it's
the same model. Like it the pre-trained model weights that you're using that we open source is also
the pre-trained model weights that we such are internally use for Pi Zero and Pi O five. And so we
really wanna help accelerate progress in the community. Um and to create that Cumbrian explosions.

Host: Yeah, that's very inspiring. I mean, I feel like that's uh everyone's sort of spending a lot
of time in the digital world and it feels like you know, now is the time to start thinking about,
you know, the the world of atoms. And uh this is sort of the perfect mix of actually like, you know,
how do you take electrons and turn it into abundance in the at you know, atoms world? And I think
about Dario Amade's essay, um, All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace. And when you really
think about the perfect manifestation of that, it's not like, you know, perfect uh agents that look
over you just like in the electronic world. It's, you know, actually something a little bit more
akin to what we're seeing here.

Kwan Wang: Yeah. And this has really been our mission from the start is to create that Cambrian
explosion. Um and you know, this is why we choose to focus on the model because we believe that is
the bottleneck to just really make robot useful across many different different tasks in the world.
And that's why we also focus on cross embodiment. You know, success for us is not defined as only
our model on our robot performing tasks that is useful. the the surface area for success is actually
much larger, which is our model performing really useful tasks on somebody else's robot out there.
Maybe that we we don't even know what that robot is like in a way that's like useful to the end
consumer. Could we maybe talk a little bit about um like the humans behind the robots here? Like um
how did the company get started? Like who are the who are your co founders and how do you all get
together and what skills do you each bring to such a complex problem? Sometimes the joke I make here
is that the human behind the robots are also robots. Not really. Um yeah, so Pi is a very, I would
say, untraditional ki company. We have a like larger than average founding teams. And some of us
work really closely together when we were at the robotic team at Google. And the robotics team at
Google was I think a really, really great environment for seeing the sign of life and creating the
relationships in the community that allow the robotic community and like these advances to flourish.
There is Lockie, uh which w we met when we uh were thinking about starting the company and it's just
been really instrumental in making sure that we're a good business. And there is Adnan, our hardware
lead, um, that came over from Andreessen. And Adnan has a really difficult job because if you want
to work on cross-embodiment, you know, remember my uh joke about how if you want to add two years to
your grad school, you bring on one more robot. The the hardware problem and the operational problem
for us is how do we built, improve and scale a fleet of Had the Joe Genius robot. It's just not one
robot platform. And because we built the organization from scratch in the beginning to to to support
that, like I think we're able to do it. But it's just a really hard uh problem. Um because Th
there's just like no two different robots in the fleet. Like how do you make sure that everything
runs smoothly? We're really good at Divide and Conquer, if you ask. Um But so how many how many co-
founders are there in total? We have Brian, we have Chelsea, Sergei, myself, Lockie, and Adnan. Is
it just necessary to have that many co founders to solve a problem as big as this, or was it a case
like you were already sort of like a unit together? You'd already worked together and you just what
whatever you started, you would all have One common question that we have is, you know, why band
together? And, you know, the first is that we really enjoy each other's company. Um, we spend a lot
of time at work and it's, you know, in some sense, give meaning to life. And so we really want to
enjoy the relationship we have at work. Um, and the second is that, you know, any one of us could
have started um a company and be successful, but the problem is just so incredibly hard. And the
chances of success is just so much higher that we bend together and we can divide and conquer the
problems. Um and you know, that's that I think one of the main reason why the progress has been much
faster than than we expected. What were the differences of um you working before in either academia
or a big industry, big company like Google and as opposed to now in a startup? This is this is the
first time for a lot of you doing a startup, right? Yeah, this is the first time for a lot of us.
Um, one of the really surprising things that we learned when we started the company is that the
infrastructure for supporting large scale general purpose robot were just not there. And you know,
this starts from the software itself. How do you collect data? What device do you use to collect
data? How do you manage the data? How do you uh annotate the data, how you get visibility into the
data, how do you run evaluation, how you build operational process. Like there wasn't company that
offered these kind of services, which is very different from software, and we were really surprised
um to to to find out. And so we ends up writing a lot of the software at Pi um ourselves, but I
think this is another area of incredible opportunity of kind of building services for robot company.
Like, you know, if you can offer remote teleph for example, if you can offer data collections, if
you can offer annotation service. Because, you know, these are functions that doesn't need to be
repeated from one company to the next. So I think there's lots of opportunity to build um kind of
support for growing robotic business. Um so that's one thing like one surprising thing that I
learned. And the second is I think one of the reasons why we have managed to achieve such progress
is that there is a really tight loop of collaboration in the entire life cycle of model development.
Um going from what tasks do you collect data for? If you collect data for the task, how do you do
it? What hardware do you use? Once after you collect the data, how do you get visibility, how do you
ensure data quality? Um, how do you then make sure that you can easily train on that data? If after
you train on that data, how do you run evaluation? Evaluation is really hard problem in robotic
because it scales super linearly to model capability. Like let's say you have a model that can
perform a two minute task. Running evaluation for that is very different from running evaluation for
a tas that's twenty minutes. Like it's not ten times harder. It's it's it's it's more than ten times
harder. Um after you run evaluation, how you can how do you can like dis distill the learning from
that evaluation to know how to improve the the model further? Like one of the really side projects I
would love to take on is to build an automated robotic research scientist. Um which is really one of
the bottleneck we have today because th th this is a really difficult skill set. um that require
intuition about the entire stack. So, you know, I would love it if there is a model that can ingest
multi-model data such as this and analyze failure modes, um, you know, understanding, oh, is the
robot performing this way because of the data that was collected, or the way that it was annotated,
or the way that we train the model, and then you know, suggest idea and actually try them to figure
out if you know those hypotheses are correct. So that's something that I would love to have and
would like dramatically unlock us. Some sometimes I make the joke in the company that we should
record all of the meetings and then train train a model to to to basically just make prediction
about what is the next sets of experience. Oh you

Host: could. You totally could. What if it's open claw and um obsidian and markdown files and like,
you know, a brain.md with like ontology that's custom to your use case and what if it's a hundred
open claws in the background that you orchestrate?

Kwan Wang: I think there's two sides to this. The first is that we already see a little bit of a
side of life where for simple failure modes um during evaluation, if you can describe the way that
the robot failed in text very precisely and very clearly, then you know, you can ask a language
model to make very reasonable recommendation about what the next step is. Um but the the the flip
side is that this only works for simple cases today. And the reason why that's the case is because I
think it's pretty um fundamental limitation of the model that we have today, which is that they are
not at the core model that take action in the world and see the consequences of its own action,
especially action that changes the physical world. Um and and so I I think this kind of very
fundamental understanding about how the physical w world works is missing from the really large
fraudation model. Um and and I think that's that's one of the ingredients that's missing to to be
able to build this automated robot research scientists.

Host: What's interesting about OpenClaw, I don't know, I mean, basically it can go and it can just
do things, which is interesting. And then at that point it's on the research lab to provide like,
you know, CLI MCP endpoints to the things that might control robots or uh reconfigure rooms or I
mean I think Carpathy feels like he's he's starting to talk a bunch about this where you know if you
mix auto research plus what he's been talking about with markdown files. Like it might just happen
in the open. Like it you know, there's a sort of sense that you have to make something much, much
more complicated to make it work, but what if that's just wrong? What if we just have markdown files
and agents and you know, you could make it yourself with, you know, literally clawed code and MCP
today? What if it's not an algorithm problem? It's just literally an integration challenge.

Kwan Wang: We have a version of this internally that I use a lot. There was a point when I was
spending a um embarrassingly large amount of money on API queries. Yeah, yeah. Um and you know the
my team was like, Kwan, what are you doing?

Host: Oh, I'm that guy at Y Combinator right now.

Kwan Wang: So uh to to t to give you an example, um we have a uh Claude skill that's essentially
serving the role of a pre training on call today. Um so you know, we have these pre training runs
that are really large. Um it's very I think a difficult exercise to keep them alive, to you know,
for them to continue to churn just because there's so many things that can go wrong. And we have um
I I I prototype a pre training on call that kind of babysit the run and have the permission to take
action to remedy error that it see. Um and the one of the surprising outcome of that exercise is
that it it leads to about fifty percent improvement in compute usage, like just overall compute
utilization for that large pre training run, which is huge for us. Um and you know, this was just a
s small, simple prototype that that I built and I think like there's a lot more to be done.

Host: Kwan, this is incredible. Thank you so much for everything. Thank you for making physical
intelligence. Thank you for showing us these incredible demos. And uh honestly, like the thing that
gives me the most hope is this idea that there's an entity, there's a you know research lab out
there that is focused on giving this to the world, you know, about to create this Cambrian explosion
of robotic startups. So someone watching right now will be inspired by this and uh, you know, start
playing with your models and they might create a robot that uh touches billions of people's lives in
for the good.

Kwan Wang: Thank you for having me. Been a pleasure. Um to the listener, the one takeaway that I
want you to have is I think robotic has changed a lot and the cost of building in robotic has
decreased and I think will continue to d dramatically um decrease. And it also required a very
different kind of scrappy skill set. um that young startup like needs. We hope to enable really an
explosion of many, many, many different robotic use case. And, you know, always reach out to us if
you want to collaborate.

Host: Thanks, man. Thanks so much.

Kwan Wang: Thank you.
