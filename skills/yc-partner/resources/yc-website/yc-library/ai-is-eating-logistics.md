## Transcript

Host: Logistics is a very scale-driven industry, and so the bigger you get, the cheaper you get. Our
take is that we can make the price of shipping anything by ocean container shipping between 8 and
10% cheaper over the next few years, and AI is a big part of that. So our AI for that saved us 2% of
our ocean freight spend while improving transit time 20%. Usually that's a trade-off. It's like
either faster or cheaper, but not both.

Host: And you're at $2 billion a year revenue and just getting started. Welcome back to another
episode of the Light Cone. We've got a real treat today. We have Ryan Peterson of Flexport with us.
He went through YC in 2014 and he is easily one of the most awesome founders I've ever met.

[Laughter]

Host: Ryan, thanks a lot for joining.

Ryan Peterson: Thank you.

Host: To start, Ryan, what is Flexport and what are some of the things in AI you're actually
implementing right now?

Ryan Peterson: So Flexport is a global logistics company built around a modern tech stack, and that
means we help companies ship cargo from point A to point B across any mode of transport: air, truck,
and rail, and get that cargo delivered hopefully on time and in full at a lower cost thanks to the
tech. What we're doing with AI is, I had to make an exhaustive extend the length of to pull that
off. But it starts with customer user experience. What can we do with their data? Getting them
better access. How do we load containers in the optimal way? How do we put that container onto the
right ship at the lowest cost while maintaining or beating transit time expectations? Automating
just tons of work that's done in email or that you or phone, or work that you wouldn't even do
because the cost is too high for a human, but actually does create some value that's worth it with
AI. So most contracts in logistics come in giant Excel files, thousands of rows and you know a dozen
tabs. You can't just feed that to OpenAI and get an answer, get a structured JSON file back. It
needs intelligence. But writing code and then having AI write the code. You write a parser that
ingests it, and then have AI that can write those parsers for you. Learning, it's an endless list,
and we feel like we don't even know all the things that they can do. It's still pretty new. So
basically one of the most human intensive things now can be streamlined to the point where actually
it might affect GDP in the world. Our take is that we can make the price of shipping anything by
ocean container shipping cheaper by between eight and 10% cheaper over the next few years. And AI is
a big, not the only part of that, but a big part of that as our business model. The way we think
about it is as I call it "scale economies shared," which is the bigger you get, the cheaper you get.
The more automation is a form of scale, and the bigger you get or the cheaper you get, you lower
your cost, you give that share with your customer, which will make them do even more volume with
you. There's scale benefits that come. Logistics is a very scale-driven industry, and so the bigger
you get, the cheaper you get, like the Costco model. I like I love Costco even though I don't shop
there. I just love the business. You keep driving down the price that makes you more attractive,
more competitive, and just keep going.

Host: And you're at $2 billion a year revenue and just getting started.

Ryan Peterson: Just getting started. Yes.

Host: Something I'm curious about. So from our perspective, we work with all the startups, and we've
seen like AI over the last couple years go from like when ChatGPT launched and then like some
startups in the batch start playing around with it, and it's become like progressively more serious.
Um, I think you're the first person we've had on the show who's like running a company at scale that
was founded pre-AI. What's like, what have the last few years been like for you from that
perspective? From like ChatGPT launch, like at what point did it start becoming like a thing you
were paying more attention to?

Ryan Peterson: Like so many other people is on November, was it 2022? It's already been a few years
since the ChatGPT launch. Been personally obsessed ever since then. It's interesting to watch it
take hold at the company, and in some cases not take hold, and you then saying like, "Come on, guys,
we can't be this boomer company. Like everybody needs to be using this." We're trying to drive that
sense of paranoia from the top, from me, but many others in the company, maybe even more paranoid
than me or more enthusiastic, excited than me as well, to say that story that we say of like, "Well,
we're the only large logistics company founded since the web browser." And I know there's a kid in
the YC batch who say, "Hey, we're the only freight forwarder founded since GPT November 2022." Like
he's got a point.

[Laughter]

Ryan Peterson: So we we have to be leading on this. This is true of incumbents in an industry. They
have some real advantages when it comes to AI and benefiting from it. And one is the scale of the
data. Two is the domain experience to know okay, which problems should we be solving. And some of
those problems are small enough that you shouldn't start a whole company around the problem. It's
maybe a feature, not a company, but for them, it's great. It's a valuable feature that they could
add. And third is distribution. Like when we build, or any large company builds a great AI product,
the next day it can be used by thousands of companies. Whereas a startup doing that has to go beg
people for their data to train the model, and trust, get earn their trust to have that data from a
security compliance standpoint, and then third, get the customer, you know, so that's the huge
advantage that any incumbent will have. And we think we definitely feel that we have that advantage
at our scale. Um, but the flip side, where I think we also have an advantage, is that we are still a
young company relative to our industry, but young in terms of our tech stack. Like we build our own
tech, therefore we can implement and integrate AI and just add it wherever we want. Most of our
competitors treat AI, treat technology period, as a service that they pay for. In many cases, like
desktop app or like Windows remote desktop is very common in our industry, but still, it's something
they buy, and therefore you don't control the codebase. If you wanted to add AI to automate
something or do something, you're like, it's not really, it's hard.

Host: Has there been a specific moment since GPT launch where you started as a company taking it
more seriously? Or because my, like the first version was a toy, even within the YC batches, like we
sort of see some founders playing around with things, but it wasn't clear that they'd actually be
like companies founded on it. So I'm just curious what, like founder running large-scale company,
you start out, you're like, "This is really interesting to me personally." Like was there some
moment where you're like, "Oh, like we should probably try and like build something or do something
internally with this?"

Ryan Peterson: Yeah, I think a lot of it has come through in our hackathons. But there could be an
interesting metric here: is like, what percentage of hackathon projects, first of all, used AI? Like
we're building something with large language models. And which percent of the projects actually you
decided to fund and push into like, "Let's actually make this thing real. It's not just a hack."

Host: Is hackathons something you've done for a while?

Ryan Peterson: Yeah, we usually do two a year.

Host: Okay.

Ryan Peterson: I think now we're like kind of religious about two every year, but um, it's one to
two a year. Where and for us, it's very much a free-for-all. You can build anything you want. If you
look now at the last two hackathons we've done, it's been like 90% LLM-based projects. In my, I
haven't studied it, but it's just like feeling my gut. Whereas probably 18 months ago, there were
like four or five. And we, there's probably 50, 60 teams that do a hackathon project each time. In
the beginning of Flexport, I was very much of this idea that like you just let smart people get out
of their way and go execute.

Host: Oh, that sounds like manager mode.

Ryan Peterson: It was. I had way too much manager mode, and I had this idea of like, human beings
are going to flourish if only they could be set free.

[Laughter]

Ryan Peterson: They don't want to be told what to do by the man. That's why I started a company. I
don't want to be told what to do. And I went through my own cheeky moment of founder mode and
recognizing, "Oh, you got to be way more top-down and directive and tell people what to do and get
people aligned and rowing in the right direction." And that's been my evolution the last two years
at Flexport. Been pretty way more hands-on and hardcore in directing the business. But then as I see
these hackathons, I'm like, "I never would have come up with that idea in a million years." And I
got to let these guys build what they want to build and flourish. And so I'm starting to now come
back on myself and say, "Where's the room in our product roadmap for bottoms-up innovation?"
Certainly you see it in these hackathons. Trying to maybe even start making sure I do the hackathon
timing before we say we do our kind of roadmap exercise every six months or so. We should probably
do the hackathon right before that, so that when you see a great idea, you can budget it instead of
after the budget.

Host: I mean, there's a noteworthy change here that's happening for you that, um, I mean, I think
most companies might throw a hackathon and then in most hackathons, the, the 90% of the projects are
just like toys and you never return to them again. Like, you know, someone gets a nice participation
trophy and that's it.

Ryan Peterson: Yeah.

Host: But like, it sounds like the difference right now in the age of LLMs and age of intelligence
is that these hackathon things are actually turning into real product lines and features for you.

Ryan Peterson: Yes. And at the very least, into debates in my head of being like, "Man, I've got to
do that. But also, I lost." We're going to we're going to crush everybody with just our regular
roadmap. But I had this after the very, I think our last, our next hackathon's in two weeks. So the
last one was six months ago. I remember thinking afterwards, I'm like, "You know what, we could just
only do that stuff, and we'll also win."

Host: Yeah, maybe win faster. Maybe.

Ryan Peterson: It's highly unlikely that the person at the top now knows best what the best
implications are, applications are. It's just as likely that someone on the front lines closer to
the problem is going to go, "Hey, look, watch, it can do this." You go, "Oh man, I wouldn't have
guessed it could do that."

Host: You kind of need engineers who are just really into it and have been playing around with it
and just like understand how to like build the products in the first place to come up with the ideas
probably.

Ryan Peterson: Yeah. Engineers, and engineers being really close to the business, is something we've
always prided ourselves on like really being in the weeds. And one of the other things that we've
done is create a program for non-engineers to learn AI skills. A kind of formalized program, so your
manager has to agree, but you get one day a week for 90 days. It's a 90-day program, one day a week,
where we teach you kind of an AI boot camp vibe: coding and different ways to apply. And this is a
new program. So we're only about six months into this. We'll see how it works out. But people love
it, and you are seeing gains. But the promise of the leader who created this and convinced the
managers to give up someone for 20% of their time to go into it was, "I will return them to you as
10 times more productive than their peers." I'm sure we haven't achieved that, or it would show up
in the metrics, but that is the, you know, that's the idea.

Host: How are you training all these folks to uplevel skill in AI? What are what are the sorts of
things they're learning?

Ryan Peterson: Certainly it's Cursor and a set of related products like that that let, I think we're
using something called Streamlit, but probably there's YC company. I don't know, maybe we should use
Replit or something, but it's similar ideas. You can spin up, build your own little apps, um, build
workflow automation tools to say, okay, because a lot of what Flexport is, we call it freight
forwarding. I've often joked it should be called "freight email forwarding." You're like taking docs
and sending it on. So how do you look at a person's job? And there's no one better to look at it
than the person doing the job and saying, "Oh man, I'm doing the same thing over and over again.
What if I instead?" It's like if everybody was an engineer, they would, and I've thought about this
in the past is saying, "Hey, what if I took one group of engineers and hire them as engineers, as a
big bait and switch, and then tell them actually you're just moving freight, sorry, and watch them
automate their way out of the job, right?" And you sort of say, "Okay, I never really wanted to do
that to an engineer because I feel like I'd just have a revolt." But now you're kind of like, "Well,
I could do it to a non-engineer who's already doing that job and turn them into a, you know, a
lightweight no-code."

Host: Which is cool.

Ryan Peterson: Yeah.

Host: This is going the other direction where you're taking really all these super domain experts
and now they can finally build and they can automate themselves out of it instead of getting the
engineer to do it.

Ryan Peterson: Yeah. And that program started in our Amsterdam office. We have an engineering office
in Amsterdam. It started there. I think they did it without me knowing about it for the first six
months, and then now we're like, "Oh, this is great. Everybody loves it." So we're starting to bring
it global to other offices.

Host: I wonder if you could share some examples of the AI projects that you have rolled out that
have been most impactful over the last couple years, both customer-facing features, but also like
any internal operational things that you guys have automated that maybe the customers have no idea
about.

Ryan Peterson: Yeah. Um, the customer-facing one, probably the most impactful. Like a lot of what
you care about from your logistics company is your data. What's going on with my supply chain, what,
the types of data that people are looking at. So the way Flexport works, you place orders to your
factories through Flexport. So I'm replenishing my inventory. I'm buying things. I'm placing
purchase orders. So those flow out to the factory. Factory becomes a user. There's a nice network
effect there. Once the cargo is ready, they place a booking, and then we execute that booking to
move the freight to come pick it up on this date. Uh, and we'll execute it by air, ocean, truck,
rail, whatever, and move it across the world for you. So that's kind of the loop that we're trying
to run. So you care a lot about the data for on-time performance, skew level performance, cost. You
care a lot about that. There's customs attributes here that are super important with tariffs and
everything that's happening. So being able to get that data is one of the core areas that Flexport
shines already historically with AI. And this did start as a hackathon project. We just built like
natural language ability so that you don't need to know SQL. You don't need to build dashboards. You
just type your question and it generates those graphs, charts, tables. Don't think it does maps yet,
but it should. And it works, and that has done one, or one, customers love it. But two is it's about
25% of our account management time is spent helping people generate reports.

Host: That's another huge metric for us: we're cheaper.

Host: We'll more people will choose us. It's not that we just started using AI with LLMs. Um, we've
had a machine learning model for doing planning for, and planning in the sense of logistics means
let's say on a containerized basis. I've got a container, which ship should it go on? Therefore, you
need all the contracts, their price, you need the sailing schedules like how long is it going to
take, which route variability, all around those both those things. So our AI for that saved us 2% of
our ocean freight spend while improving transit time 20%. Usually, that's a trade-off. It's like
either faster or cheaper, but not both. Uh, so huge win there. Customers, they don't care a lot
about those metrics. They don't care how we did it. And for that one, the unlock was parsing a bunch
of unstructured like emails and data that you get from the shipping companies. They have this, but
it's all like in a big paragraph where you couldn't just run a simple query on it before.

Interviewer: Sort of. Yeah. The way to think about it is, um, you've got if you just put a container
on the cheapest contract, you made it, it's an optimization, okay? Which one's the cheapest but also
the fastest? You know, I'm trading off. So that's one thing that machines are better at. Uh, and
then it's the scale of that. So on a given week, we have about 2,000 containers that get cancelled
by our customers. They place the booking and then they say, "Oh, actually the cargo is not ready.
The factory is late." It's just inevitable. It's going to happen. What software does that humans
could never do is go through 10 times a day and taking each one of those containers and say, "Okay,
I lost this container. It's been cancelled. Is there another container that was meant to depart one
week from now?" And I'll grab that and move it forward. That's how you get the 20% transit time
increase. And then the optimization piece of find is just find the cheapest contract like a solver
out you know algorithm to go find.

Audience Member: And the humans can't do that because it has to happen really quickly.

Interviewer: Is this happening 10 times a day for every container in the system?

Host: Okay, you know, it's just like you wouldn't, maybe you could, but you wouldn't. You'd have to
hire like a crazy—

Interviewer: If you calculate this first principle, it sounded like that first version was using
classical optimization problems and you had certain data about all these shipments inputs outputs
and scheduled. What do you think is the delta that you could get with AI? Now that you could harness
all the unstructured data, what kind of efficiencies could you get?

Host: You may be able to get a lot more now that you're starting to see tool use because the tool
itself is incredibly powerful. And I don't think an LLM will outperform that, but the LLM can use
that tool and it could do other things outside of that. So you can, we'll see. We haven't started to
do that yet. So we're actually still using that. I can actually email people or call them up and—

Interviewer: Yeah, but it could you assign the LLM the same solver problem, but it is going to
default to use this tool and then it'll also say yes, maybe this container I'm not sure if I could
move it forward. I should ask the customer would be a good idea actually email, hey, is it okay if I
bring you this container early?

Host: Like the solver's still there, but then uh basically the agent is the user.

Interviewer: Yes. Instead of right now there's not really a user or there's a there's someone who's
approving the plan and so you could make that person upstream of the solver uh choose the solver as
one of many tools. So that'd be interesting. We haven't done that yet, but and then the other thing
is so just routine work. Um, for example, you've got a lot of email communication with your customer
base. So how do you take this, you say, "Hey, I want to place a booking for a container, translate
that into a booking." Uh, LLMs are quite good at that. Or um, a big use case today is verifying
warehouse addresses and and other information and getting appointments. I've got to deliver to a
warehouse. Quite costly to call the warehouse and be like, do I have the right address? You're not
going to do it every time. And then you have a lot of misses where your address data was bad and
your truck got lost, you know, pain in the ass. Um, so LLMs now before we deliver, we if we haven't
delivered to the site in the last three months, there's an LLM agent. It does email and voice.

Host: Interesting. Wow. So if necessary, it'll actually call the warehouse and be like, "Hey—"

Interviewer: Can you confirm that two p.m. tomorrow is okay time to deliver this?"

Host: Yes. Yes, which is great because you're turning this previous communication protocol which is
very much, um, I suppose very lossy to work sort of like the internet like TCP fully um acknowledge
and you can get guarantees.

Interviewer: And sometimes it's not replacing work although I'm very happy to do so but like in some
cases the work would have been too expensive so you just didn't do the work.

Host: To do this phone call.

Interviewer: And even if a human could do it, it's like not worth it. Another good one is just
messages. So like the way we communicate with our customers some of it's email but a lot we try to
drive as much as possible through our messaging applications inside the inside the Flexport platform
there's a huge amount of signal in that customer sentiment. If a customer in a AI, we've trained the
model to detect unhappy customers in the way that they message us and then that creates an automatic
escalation to the manager of the frontline person, hey this person seems upset. There's a lot of
emotion and logistics, you know, this your stuff. Your business is on the line. You need to get it
delivered. Infinite list. Uh, we in fact we measured at the beginning of the year, we had automated
20% of the work. It was pretty low scale of automation. We're going to finish this year at 50%. And
we had set a goal for ourselves next year of 80 where we thought 80 was actually the upper limit of
what could be automated. This is it's not scientific, but now we feel like, oh, it's probably closer
to 90 to 95 currently. And then that'll get way more so as LLMs keep progressing.

Interviewer: How will that affect like the total cost of ocean freight? Like if all the human work
gets automated, does stuff actually get materially cheaper?

Host: Yeah. Uh, it's 10% of the end cost that the buyer, the importer exporter pays for their
freight. 10%. If you look at the full P&L about 10% is the labor cost in the freight forwarding
layer of logistics.

Interviewer: Wow. So so when AI is like fully rolled out, like stuff will actually get 10% cheaper.

Host: Freight moving the stuff. The cost of moving it, right? The stuff itself depends on what the
ratio is. But yeah—

Interviewer: The but like the transportation costs of like international freight is actually like
10%.

Host: On containerized ocean freight. That's our view is that we can drop the price of everything by
around 8% and maybe it goes to 9% uh over the next few years by doing this. That's has some uh big
economic ripples in terms of if it's becoming cheaper to ship things across the ocean, is it going
to create just more trade? I mean, there's also trade wars, but—

Interviewer: Exactly. It's very hard to control for that in a world where tariffs just made
everything like 10 times more expensive, but we're doing our part. Uh—

Gary Tan: I mean, the white pill on AI right now is, you know, this hope and sort of possibility
that uh AI rolled out properly across society would increase GDP 7% a year. So this would be maybe
7% a year will double you in 10 years is the law of 72.

Host: Yeah. Yeah.

Gary Tan: That is the hope, right? And I think more people should talk about that and uh and
everyone's so worried about automating away the jobs. And I just think that misunderstands the role
of companies in society. Like the role of companies is not to employ people. It's to deliver goods
and services. And in fact, whoever employs the least number of people will have the lowest cost and
win. And that's how they benefit society is lowering costs and making things more available for us
to buy and sell. And then there's this idea, well, how are people going to make money if AI is doing
all the work? And I I I think that that very much misunderstands human nature that we'll we'll just
want more things. Like there's an infinite desire inside the human soul can never be satisfied
without God. Uh, we need more stuff. Like we got to have more. We got to have more. And so—

Host: We're trying to return to uh the garden.

Gary Tan: We may get a return to some. I I think that actually the internet first, we haven't quite
reconciled this on like a spiritual philosophical level the emergence of these technologies and uh
and AI, we're not even beginning to understand what it means for us. But there's a period in history
called the axial age, it's about 500 years BC and that's when um coins really started to spread.
What you had, if you think about it with coins, is taking transactions between two people and making
them very impersonal. You no longer care who you're doing business with. I don't need of a ledger,
does this guy owe me money? What's my relationship? Do I trust? Just like here, take this thing. So
and it it actually led to this breakdown in societies because uh we just stopped being so knowing
your neighbor. Like you used to only do business with your neighbors. Now you could just do business
with any old person. The internet kind of does that at scale. What happened in the axial age? You
had this breakdown of ability for of trust and you started to get degeneracy and all kinds of like
things that start to break down in society. And simultaneously across the world you had four major
prophets that emerged. Uh, well prophets of sort. You had Buddha, you had Laozi, Confucius and
Socrates. They all lived at the exact same moment in time right as coins were taking hold as like a
hey, we need to kind of like get our hands around how how do we behave in this new world. And so I
do think there there's an opportunity here maybe it could be you, Gary at YC, uh, to be the next uh
the next Socrates.

Gary Tan: Yes. I'm in but I might not be the right person. [laughter] But I mean I particularly like
this idea that like the idea that what are humans going to do is a little bit invalid and that you
know that's a little bit like going back 500 years and saying like, "Oh my god, all of us are
farmers and then what are we going to do when modern agriculture comes?"

Host: Yeah.

Gary Tan: It's like we figured it out.

Host: Like we—

Gary Tan: Or the printing press.

Host: Yeah. Right. What are what are the monks going to do? They're transcribing words all day.
There's no more jobs for transcribers.

Gary Tan: So there will be implications for society and morality and how people relate to one
another. And obviously like we have no idea what it's early days but history does kind of repeat and
there's lessons there and figure out okay how does this. But the human nature doesn't change much
right? And you can't satisfy humans. You're just going to want more stuff. The more money you have,
the more classically right cliche, like the more you have the more you want. That's not going to go
away. So if you give people a lot more stuff, it's not like oh I'm going to quit working. Most
people aren't like that. I'm going to get a lot of stuff. I'll just quit working. You find out
you're miserable. You want to keep producing. Keep contributing.

Interviewer: One of the interesting things that has been percolating around the YC community among
young founders and like AI researchers that we've been talking to is this idea that like they're
going to be humans in the loop. The humans in the loop may well be uh some some might be like
government-mandated, right? You in fintech there's a lot around uh you cannot have an AI algorithm
like approve loans for instance. They're like requirements from the government in these highly
regulated industries to have humans in the loop. Uh and—

Host: Customs brokerage as well. We have to have a human that's approving the transaction before
before we clear customs.

Interviewer: Yeah. And so vibe coding is happening. There's this idea of you enter a prompt, it
comes back with a bunch of stuff and then you just click accept all changes without reading any of
it, right? Do you think this might happen that would this happen at Flexport or would this happen uh
more broadly across all businesses? Like what if businesses are at the core like hyper intelligent
AI that uh has access to all your systems of record, knows what to do, optimizes constantly and then
you have sort of like government-mandated liability syncs that are humans in the loop. Ideally the
organizations still actually serve human needs in which case like the decision to use, you know,
vendor A or vendor B sometimes boils down to who brought me to the nicest steakhouse last. So then
like the model for companies ends up being ASI of some sort, like some sort of AI process at the
core of each company but then you know humans attached to it as either like decision makers in like
you know accepting or preventing liability and/or holding relationships with other relationship
holders at other companies.

Host: Yeah. And presumably you're still relating with you're still here to serve humans. You know,
once we get to a world where AI is serving AI, then fair enough. You don't need to learn that much
from the uh record of human history because there's no more humans involved in the loop. And I don't
have a lot to say about that. But as long as there's humans there, there's going to humans are going
to want to relate with other humans and have a relationship. And I think we're pretty, pretty,
pretty far from humans preferring to work with AI than to work with other humans. We're seeing where
AI is doing more and more work. You know, another good example is and just that you made me think of
with your bank, you know, you have to have an approval approver, is that even our our humans in
customs brokerage across the industry, we benchmark you make about 2% mistakes and they file the
entry with 2%. And we built this sort of like AI spell checker, the two-digit code for Australia
versus Austria. You could easily get that wrong. Uh, and the AI will figure out like, oh, this thing
is not made in Australia. It's made in Austria. I guess one question for you Ryan is if you were to
start Flexport today, how would the company be different?

Interviewer: Not that different. I hope the things that Flexport did really well compared to all the
other tech companies who have tried and failed in our space both before we came along and in
parallel is um we didn't look at ourselves as a pure technology company. We're willing to pick up
the phone and solve problems with humans, drive down to the port. Still to this day, like I we've
got a new customer who's asking us to do something really weird. We need a crane on the truck to
unload this thing and we don't have that. It's not typical what we do. And I just said, "Take the
customer and I need you to drive there and follow the truck and make sure this goes well."
[laughter] So I I would not change that at all. And I think that's that that's the mistake that a
lot of tech uh people will in traditional markets will fail at cuz they're like, "Oh, if there's no
API, I can't do it." If my agent is unable to do this task, I guess the task can't be done.

Host: No tool used for cranes.

Interviewer: Yeah. And it might take you a long time and you should not try to automate that last
that tail of things. You started and grew Flexport like especially in the first few years during an
era where just like more money coming into like there's more venture capital each year coming into
startups and like you you had like multiple fundraising rounds like—

Interviewer: In what ways was that capital like an advantage? And I feel like now it's sort of
somewhat back there in the AI world now. Like the rounds are heating up, there's more money flowing
in. It just sort of like post the 2022 crash, what's your advice to the founders now who are in
these like companies that are growing and have options to raise like huge funding rounds? Like how
should they think about it?

Ryan: Every company is super unique. So don't listen to advice on the podcast. Like get someone
who's like paying attention, you know, knows the details of your business, which no one will know
better than you. Generally, capital is a beautiful thing. Having it in your bank account gives you a
lot of advantages. Uh, all you really need to care about at the end of the day is price per share
because if you issue more stock, like as long as your price per share goes up, you are richer.
Doesn't matter how many or what percent you own until it comes to control. So there's two things
that matter. Do you control your company legally or otherwise? Culturally also works, but do you
really have control over the decisions that are getting made? And do you have a job and price per
share? And that's all that matters. I think I still think that's true. That's always how I thought
about it. There's been a lot of dilution to our investors, but the price per share went up and
everybody's made better off. I didn't take away anybody's shares, so you're better off. The part
that I underappreciated and that I now take very, very seriously is the degree to which money just
wants to spend itself. And you will end up making a lot of mistakes where the biggest mistake is
believing you, for sure, every company has a lot of problems and you start to default to like, "Oh,
we'll just use money to solve this problem." And the way that manifests itself is, "Oh, I got this
thing that we need to do, okay, hire someone to do it," and you feel like you just end up very
bloated. We had too many people, you start to really slow down, and it's just a super bad cultural
approach to problem solving. Like you're going to solve the problems, not the new people that you're
going to hire. So I give this advice—only one founder's ever listened to me—but I tell founders who
are friends of mine who raise a large round: sure, go raise a big round as long as you're up round,
like you're doing good. Great. Raise a large round.

Interviewer: Then do a hiring freeze for 90 days.

Ryan: The next day, tell your team culturally like, "Nope, the money's not going to solve our
problems. We're going to solve our problems." And keep that. Sure, go hire, but it's because it's
super—it happened to us over and over again where you just like headcount got out of control. All
the plans look good. I want to fund all the—we're doing budgeting for next year and I'm like, "God,
it's so painful not to add opex, add engineers, whatever," but you got to stay disciplined and the
money will easily make that stop.

Interviewer: So I'm really psyched to hear about this idea that AI is actually transforming your
business in pretty fundamental ways. It's like coming bottom up. What does Flexport look like in
2035?

Ryan: One cool thing about Flexport is the way our vision has evolved. I mentioned we started as a
customs broker. Yeah, we do all end to end, all the way from factory floor to consumer stores. Like
we have an e-commerce business that does fulfillment, retail store distribution, et cetera. So we
want to take that globally to where you can really ship anything anywhere by any means, any mode, in
any quantity, and do it all via code like all available via APIs or voice or just like easy to
execute transactions at the lowest cost. Automate away the cost so that brands, companies of all
kinds don't spend time thinking about logistics. Logistics should be this utility that just works,
just like you don't spend time thinking about the electrical grid. You flip the light switch, you
get power. You go back to doing your thing, which is making something people want and talking to
users, right? That's what I think companies should do. Our customers should be doing that all day.
Like make great products, make a great brand to sell those products, and we'll take care of
everything in between in the most automated, efficient, reliable ways possible on a global basis. So
today, and we have a long ways to go to actually make all that true. First off, the automation stuff
I talked about—making progress, but we got to keep going. And then the global aspect. So we have
employees we shipped cargo to and from 147 countries last year, but we only have employees in 22
countries and therefore people on the ground that can do the work. Yes, we are automating that work,
and in fact it's easier for us to automate our own employees' work than it is some third party
company that's doing work. You know, even though they're in our software, it's very hard to
automate. We don't know what they're doing. Um, so we want to be in every country by 2035,
certainly. In fact, our roadmap has us covering 95% of all container trade with our own people doing
all the work in the country in 2028. So by 2035, I think we could realistically say, "Look, we'll be
everywhere that's legal," and that is a big extension of our original vision. And I didn't have all
that in mind when I did YC demo day. My pitch was like, "We'll do customs and then we'll add some
other stuff," but it wasn't like, "We will cover the earth. Any two planets on earth, whatever you
want to move, we'll move it." Uh, so yeah, it's a very ambitious goal. The good thing is I really
genuinely—we're going to win on tech. We're winning. We're going to extend our lead there relative
to our peers and competitors. We're behind them on the global side. And that's super fun. If you
told 25-year-old me they're like, "Oh, Ryan, your job this year is we got to launch Flexport in
Indonesia, Australia, Japan, Philippines, Turkey, and Poland, and France," I'd be like, "Oh my,
really? I get to go to all those places and talk to the locals and stuff." So it's a pretty fun
moment in our history, but also really challenging. But fun. Kind of challenging.

Interviewer: Yeah, no better kind. Ryan, thank you so much for joining us, man. It's always a
pleasure.

Ryan: All right, we'll see you guys next time.
