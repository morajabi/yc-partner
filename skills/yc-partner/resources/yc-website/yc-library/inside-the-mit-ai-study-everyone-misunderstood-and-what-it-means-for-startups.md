## Transcript

Host: Engineering teams at these orgs are filled with people that themselves don't actually really
believe in AI, don't use codegen tools, think it's all super overhyped, are really excited when an
MIT study comes out saying that it's all like hype and retweeted and [laughter] and really want, cuz
it's a narrative they want to believe. But the consequence of that for the companies is that they
can't build the product. So if your engineers don't believe in this, then how are you going to build
a product that actually works? The knock on effect for startups then is if you can actually build
something that works, the enterprises will talk to you because they have no other options. Can't
build it internally, can't go to an established company. Um, so the startups are actually getting
like the shot that they never had before.

Host: I guarantee you someone who's watching this right now and [music] uh you've just horribly
triggered them. Welcome back to another episode of the Light Cone. One of the things that has been
really pissing me off is these AI influencers. You see them on X, you see them on YouTube, and
they're claiming that 95% of AI projects are failures. And that's proof that AI is a scam. What's
the real story, Jared? You actually dug in to the MIT report that these people are grifting with.
What does the report actually say?

Jared Friedman: What really went viral was like tweets about this study. And I think the tweets are
actually quite misleading. Diana and I were talking to a bunch of college students recently and they
had concluded just by reading like the tweet version of the study that like oh all these AI startups
that YC is talking about like must not be working because the study says that they all fail. But
actually the more I read the study, the more I realized it was actually confirming a lot of the
things we've talked about here on this podcast about what AI agents are really like in the real
world and what approaches and categories are working. And so I thought it'd be interesting for us to
talk about what the study really says because it's a very different approach to the go to market for
all these AI solutions is not just standard enterprise sales. I think one of the big things that we
talk a lot about is this aspect of um teams, startup and founders embedding themselves into the
business processes and really growing a lot of the internal systems of record and going deep deep
deep in the integration which is not something that has been typically done in the SaaS world. It's
like very plug and play which is different but when you do succeed and plug into the systems of
record the pot of gold is actually quite big but it does take a long time. We actually have a lot of
examples and work with companies that have succeeded which we can talk about later.

Host: You had a really great way of like having like a mental model of like what typically happens
when an enterprise tries to adopt AI and like why the failure rate is so high. Can you give people
some intuition?

Gary Tan: Yeah, if you think about it, enterprises are trying to get something done and they've got
uh internal IT or sometimes when internal IT doesn't do it, they go out and they get an Ernst &
Young or they get some much bigger consulting shop, a Deloitte to come in. And uh it turns out if
anyone has ever used internal IT systems, generally internal IT systems are bad. And then not only
that, if you decide that, you know, you can't build it in-house and you have to go to consulting,
well, now you've got two problems. The output of the study is no surprise to me in that the majority
of software that actually gets built in the world is very, very bad. To be fair to IT consultants,
um, Apple is very bad at software. You know, my favorite example is Apple of the company that can
have infinite access to capital and infinite access to the smartest people in the world. All of us
use uh iPhones and uh I use the calendar app. I think you guys do too. We use it many times per day
due to our schedules and uh even the calendar app is a piece of trash. Like how you know you
probably run into some sort of weird bug in that like almost every single day. So Apple, a company
with infinite resources and infinite access to the smartest people in the world, cannot make a good
calendar app. So you know, if that's true for Apple, how could any normal company, let alone an
internal IT system, let alone like Deloitte or Ernst & Young, like very well-meaning people, but
like you know, most of the time the output of something like that is bad. I think a lot of what goes
on is that in the big enterprises to really deploy sophisticated software it usually has to be used
by multiple teams across the org. And so big enterprises like there's just always going to be like
political battles and turf wars and various things going on. And so part of the reason I think these
enterprises go to consultants is like you can go to an Ernst & Young and get them to like meet with
like the data science team, the customer support team, the like IT team and like write up a bunch of
docs about what everyone wants and sort of almost play like some sort of mediator role of hey like
here's kind of what we're aligned on and here's like the spec that will work for everyone. The
challenge is like then you actually have which I think is valuable but then the next step is to
actually like implement that and at which point the consultants don't have like the technical
expertise to build the software and then often in the enterprise even if they have an internal
software team like the systems are just like so old and like siloed that you actually need both like
the external consultancy expertise to bring everyone together but then also the software expertise
to actually build the systems. And is the thing that you end up with at the end like basically like
a camel, you know, a horse designed by a committee.

Diana Hu: I mean, I think Jared and I actually um now summer 2020, a while ago worked with a company
called Tactile that's building sort of like a high level like a business decision engine for banks
in particular. So it does things like in real time can help them go through like uh KYC and AML to
figure out um someone who's applied for a loan for example and then instantly figure out oh yeah
like does this person have the right credit? Do they make the right business rules and do that like
you know millions of times per day at scale? The banks themselves like Citibank and JP Morgan have
tried to build this kind of software themselves and it's in each case it's taken years three to five
years and tens of millions of dollars to actually get this implemented whereas Tactile was able to
build a REST API that makes decisions in real time. You can plug the latest AI models into it. uh
and they've been able to do that all for a fraction of the budget and in way less time.

Host: And there's a company that I worked with called Greenlight that also sells AI systems to
banks. And they were telling me a story that is exactly along the lines of what Gary was talking
about where there is a bank that they were trying to sell to and the deal fell through because the
bank had an existing relationship with Ernst & Young, who apparently builds all the software for the
bank, which is apparently not that uncommon. And they're like, well, you know, we trust our vendor,
Ernst & Young. We've been working with them for years. They say that they're going to build this AI
system and that's where they got it all wrong.

Jared Friedman: Yeah. And so Ernst & Young spends a year trying to build this AI system. It doesn't
work at all. And the bank comes back to Greenlight is like, "Uh, actually, could you guys build this
for us?" And Greenlight now has their system like fully deployed at the bank and it's actually
working. An interesting thing about the report is that of the projects that they surveyed, two-
thirds of them were projects where the enterprise built an internal software project or did it with
the help of a consulting agency and only one-third was ones where they bought a product from an
outside agency like a Greenlight. And so enterprises are mostly trying to build things in house, but
the success rate of the ones where the enterprise went with an outside vendor like a Greenlight or a
Tactile was much higher than the success rate of when they tried to build stuff themselves. I mean,
why do you think this is like, you know, I certainly have my theories, but you know, going back to
the Apple thing, my sense is that there actually just aren't that many people who uh are polymaths
enough to be good at product and good at engineering to make things that actually work. Like there
are lots of people out there who are really really good engineers, but you know, maybe they're just
in like the coding cave all day and they can't relate to, you know, someone working at a bank cuz
they just like don't step outside of their coding cave. And then way over on the other end like you
know that sort of goes back to the user like why doesn't the user just do this? There's some
evidence that maybe they will you know there are all these examples of uh people like you know Varun
Mohan from Windsurf mentioned that back when he was uh working on that with his sales leader who
might not have a engineering degree they used Windsurf to create their own tools. So way out at like
the 150 IQ type uh organizations in the world this is already happening but for now like a lot of
the people who really understand the domain they can't code or they don't understand tech or they
can't you know do design or product and ship it. So, you know, for now there's just this startup-
shaped hole in basically uh every process or every sort of annoying system that should exist that
doesn't exist yet. It's a very rare breed of skill sets where they have a lot of the extreme up-to-
date latest and greatest AI understanding and product taste and at the same time to some extent a
lot of the kind of humanity in a sense to understand all the human processes to then grow those into
into a product and I think there's a different permutation of what you both have mentioned around uh
companies going after consultants as a solution as vendor. This is company that Jared and I were
good partners with Castle AI. They're also selling to banks as a this a theme here.

Diana Hu: They're basically building a AI mortgage servicer. There's a lot of uh vendors around that
have been around for like decades with very old system and they're catching on as well. They know
that their lunch is going to get eaten these vendors and they are adding AI on top of it. And what
happens when Castle goes into all these sales conversations with the banks? They have to do a bake
off with the current incumbent solution. And turns out what they learn the the banks still do it
because they trust the vendor. They've been around with them for a long time. Not not just a
consultant but a regular old school software system. And funny thing is a lot of times these
products are very subpar. The particular customers they work with, they like closed off the bake off
because it's like wow the this vendor solution was just AI slapped on top of it. So there's such
thing as like it could be AI on the vendor side and they add it but is lacking this aspect of being
really native from the beginning and having that really good taste on the product. And this is how
Castle has closed some of these large banks which is impressive just [music] one year after the
batch now.

Host: YC's next batch is now taking applications. Got a startup in you? Apply at y
combinator.com/apply. It's never too early and filling out the app will level up your idea. Okay,
back to the video.

Host: And Diana, you have another example of a company, speaking of Apple, that actually sold to a
fan company that Oh, yeah. had tried to implement an internal solution and had it not work. Maybe
you can tell us about that.

Diana Hu: This is a very impressive case study. The company is called Reduct. They just announced
their Series B recently and they actually closed a fan company 154 days after the batch which is I
haven't seen that happen. And this big fan company reached out to them because they did a YC launch.
That's how they found them. So our launches get people watching them and they reached out. It's like
oh this is interesting. We'll love to try it and we've been working on a solution. Turns out this
particular company has been trying to what what Reduct does is uh document processing for AI and
this company has been having a lot of internal systems and build internal solutions for years to run
a lot of their operations and a lot of the solution they try they tried open source they tried AWS
Tesseract all sorts of OCR solutions and they were not cutting the mark and this is where product
excellence really got Reduct to win the deal and be a pretty big one. But the thing about this one
that still took time to go through it. I mean so Reduct had to compete with internal team and they
had to have a lot of finesse to navigate a lot of the politics which is actually one of the aspects
that the MIT paper does talk. So we do agree with that. There's still a lot of work to get there and
but they got it done and it's still like hard but at the end of it they do have this awesome deal
with them and they've been live in production for more than a year or two now.

Host: Yeah. What was the secret to avoid uh pissing off the wrong people, you know, still be in the
running and uh eventually win?

Diana Hu: This is where you do things that don't scale. One of the things that they did is they
became really good friends with the champion and really building friendship with them and they saw
that oh there's these really smart kids and I want to take a shot on them and is uh this is what I
think a lot of the story around YC founders selling to big enterprises. I think there's something
about this ambition and really optimism from founders that is contagious that really gets people
excited. It's like this is a bit of a boring problem to like process documents but you're like super
jazz about it and I'll give you a shot and then when they do they surpass a lot of the expectations
and it's cool.

Host: I've heard it's it's actually a sort of a particular archetype of big company employee. It's
someone that really wants to do a startup or has always sort of had dreams of a startup but it's not
they're not actually ever going to do it. They're too risk-averse and so they can kind of live
vicariously through an exciting startup with founders that they get along with. And if you find
someone like that to be your champion, it's like they want you to succeed because they're going to
feel like they're on the startup journey as well.

Diana Hu: I think so. I think it's finding more people like that that want to nurture that inner
child that had this dream of startups but they didn't get to do it.

Host: What's funny is this is a good example of uh when you meet uh especially young founders often
they try to like dress up like they'll just dress up in a suit and they like copy Microsoft's
homepage or something and they shouldn't do that. Like they should just try to be a little bit more
authentic. Like it's actually fine to be a startup. Like it's important to come off as smart and
with it, but you do not need to copy the formalism of, you know, sort of wearing a suit or the
equivalent of that in like your interactions with people.

Host: Another good tactic is to find uh founders whose companies were acquired by big companies and
get them to be your champion. With TripleByte, we essentially we were able to work with Apple and
there were like almost no recruiting companies working with Apple and that was all because of a a YC
company Q started by Robbie Walker and Danny Gross actually um that had been acquired by Apple and
then they helped us get in there.

and then I actually, I remember we got like a pilot with Oracle through a founder who had sold his
company to Oracle and was just pushing for them to hire better engineers. And helped us through
procurement and gave us all the internal politics and step-by-step playbook to the pilot going.

Host: I think that's a special thing about being here in Silicon Valley is this pay it forward
aspect that I think you cannot measure in a study.

Host: One of the other interesting things from this paper that's also I think a very optimistic
point that got lost in the tweet version of this paper is that there's overwhelming demand from
enterprises to adopt AI, and they're way more willing to take bets on new startups. So, you know,
all these tricks are helpful, but I do think it's probably much easier to sell to a FANG company now
some AI agent than it was back when you were running Triple Bite.

Host: But it sort of ties back into this original study, something we've talked about and maybe
tweeted about is that I think the enterprises would certainly prefer to buy these solutions from
established software companies—even established startups, like late-stage startups that have been
around for a while and have lots of funding and feel less risky—but they fundamentally can't build
the products. And I think many of the YC partners feel that a lot of the time it's just because the
engineering teams at these orgs are filled with people that themselves don't actually really believe
in AI, don't use codegen tools, don't think it's all super overhyped. They're really excited when an
MIT study comes out saying that it's all like hype and retweeted. [laughter] And really want because
it's a narrative they want to believe. But the consequence of that for the companies is that they
can't build the product. So if your engineers don't believe in this, then how are you going to build
a product that actually works? The knock-on effect for startups then is if you can actually build
something that works, the enterprises will talk to you because they have no other options. Can't
build it internally, can't go to an established company. So the startups are actually getting like
the shot that they never had before.

Host: I guarantee you someone's watching this right now and you've just horribly triggered them.

Host: Oh yeah. No, I tweeted this and I got lots of angry emails. [laughter]

Host: And the message for you guys out there—the irony is all you have to do is literally just try
it. Like, if you code and you're a great engineer, or even an okay engineer, honestly, if you just
try this stuff and get really good at it and you give it a shot—it's not like I try it once and it
screwed up a variable name and now I'm mad and I'll never use it again, right? It's actually like
invest into a real project. It doesn't have to be your main work. It could just be a side project.
Do something super fun. We literally had a Vibe coding dad's night about a month ago, and you know,
people who are not even technical. We had like a landlord who was making a Vibe code thing for their
tenants so that they could see if they had paid their rent or something. It's like you will be
amazed. And so the people who feel this, it's like just give it a shot because you, you know, you
are sort of the perfect people in the world to use these tools. And even if—I mean, honestly, it
turns 10x engineers into 100x engineers and it turns 1x engineers into 10x engineers. I mean, that's
like such a gift, but it requires an overcoming of like this very real emotion that's inside of
people.

Host: Yeah. The other instance over the last week where I've just seen this sort of like the people
waiting for the "it's overhyped" narrative was after that Andrej Karpathy Dwarkesh interview. Did
you guys see that?

Host: Yeah, I told you ten years.

Host: Yeah, I saw, I read the tweet. The tweets are essentially, "Oh, like, you know, Karpathy says
agents are overhyped and can't do the work." So then I listened to the interview, and it's like the
point he's making is you can't just like give an agent a prompt and expect it to do everything
perfectly the first time. Like, you still actually have to do lots of work to provide the right data
and do all the correct context and actually do the evals and all like the actual tooling. And my
interpretation of that was that's like a fantastic opportunity for startups, and anyone who can
build software [laughter]—there's like tons of stuff that's still yet to build. And I just found it
like an interesting Rorschach test, almost. It's like if you fundamentally want to believe that
everything is overhyped, you're going to read into that, "Oh yeah, like, look, like an AI expert
confirms it's overhyped." But if you listen to actually what he's saying, there's like tons of
opportunity to build really great tooling. It's like these things are a tool and you just have to
help them work better versus expect that they're all just going to be absolute magic and work
without any help.

Host: Well, I think the exciting thing is basically there's just a lot of opportunity to rebuild all
these systems to be AI native, because software needs to be completely rewritten to work with AI,
which is really just lots of opportunities for founders, which is cool. Here's one other point from
the study that I also thought was really interesting in terms of why enterprise is such a big
opportunity for startups. I'll actually read this quote. This is from some enterprise buyer person:
"We're currently evaluating five different gen AI solutions. But once we've invested time in
training a system, the switching costs will become prohibitive."

Host: That's the CIO of a $5 billion financial services firm. Fantastic.

Host: Right.

Host: That sounds like a moat to me.

Host: Right. Exactly. [clears throat] I hadn't heard such a direct quote from like a legit
enterprise buyer about that before. So all these people who are worried that these like ChatGPT
wrappers won't have moats—like, that's the moat.

Host: So there you have it. The AI doomer influencers have been leading you astray. AI is hard to
actually implement. And it turns out it's so hard to implement that only 5% of the time it actually
works. But it also turns out that if you're a startup founder and you're a really good one at YC,
the acceptance rate is under 1% now. So we gave you a whole bunch of examples of people who are in
that 1% who then went on to be a part of like probably that top 1% of implementations that actually
work, because some of the smartest, best product people, engineers, are actually focused on it.
Ultimately, it's about people who are really, really great at technology, but also are polymaths.
They understand other people, can understand what that bank—you know, $5 billion fintech CIO—really,
really wants. That's the good news. You should not look at these stats and say, "I could never be a
part of that 5%." If you're actually really, really good, you absolutely can be, and we have so many
examples of that at YC. So with that, we'll see you guys next time.
