## Transcript

Calvin French-Owen (guest): I feel like when I'm using Claude code, it's like, oh, I feel like I'm
flying through the code. When

Gary Tan (host): it's in your CLI, this thing can debug nested delayed jobs like five levels in and
figure out what the bug was and then write a test for it and it never happens again. This is insane.
I think

Calvin French-Owen (guest): everyone who's experimenting with this stuff on like a hobbyist level or
at like a very small startup, they're just pushing the coding agents as far as they can go. Because
it's like you don't really have time to figure out anything else. Like as a startup you have limited
runway, you're just going to orient around speed. I think at a bigger company you have a lot more to
lose. What are some of the tips to become a top 1% user of coding agents?

Gary Tan (host): Yeah, what's your stack?

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of The Lightcone. Gary,
are you are you ready to

Gary Tan (host): record? I'm I'm in plan mode right now, but okay, yeah, I guess it's time. Sorry
about that. Well, welcome to another episode of The Lightcone. And today we have an incredible
guest, Calvin French Owen. He's one of the first people to create Codex at OpenAI. And before that,
he started Segment, which is a multi billion dollar company that got to a very successful exit.
Calvin, welcome back.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Thanks for having me. I guess what

Gary Tan (host): a crazy time for all of us. Uh I recently got very, very addicted to Claude Code.
And uh I would describe it as like ten years ago I was a marathon runner and I loved doing it, and
then I suffered a catastrophic knee injury, which is called manager mode. And I uh stopped coding,
which is tragic and horrible. Uh but now the last nine days have been like this incredible unlock uh
of all the things I remember being able to do and it's like, you know, I got a new total knee
replacement and actually it's a bionic knee and it allows me to run five times faster. What's your
take on it? Because you're I mean, right out there at the forefront of it. I mean, Codex pioneered
all of the a lot of the ideas that now like everyone still uses and Codex is still evolving too.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): For brief context, when I was at OpenAI, um I was working on the Codex
web product. At the time, Cursor was out in the market, and they had kind of built this shim uh
around I think it was Sonnet 3.5, uh and it was able to work in your IDE. FOD code had just come out
uh and it was working as a CLI. And we kind of had this idea like, hey, in the future. Coding is
really gonna feel more like talking to a coworker. Like you're gonna send off a question and then
they'll go off and do something and come back to you with a PR. Uh and so that's where we started
with this web view. Uh and that's what we were building. I think directionally that's still kind of
correct for where things should go, but obviously now. Everyone is coding with CLIs instead. Like
they're using those tools a lot more, whether it's Claude Code or whether it's Codex. And I think,
at least for me, kind of the lesson in that is I think in some sense you're right that like everyone
is going to become a manager in the future, or at least that's my hot take. But in order to get
there, there are steps along the way and you have to really build a lot of trust in the model and
understand what it's doing.

Gary Tan (host): You recently came over to Claude Code. What's the transition been like in terms of
as using it as your you know, one of your stacks? Yeah, yeah.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): So Claude Code is uh certainly my kind of like daily driver today. And
honestly this has switched every few months. Uh for a while I was deeply in cursor. I think their
new model, which is really fast, is actually quite good. Then I kind of moved over to Quad Code,
especially with Opus. Quad code is a really interesting product, and I think it's underrated how
good the both product and model are working together. If you study them closely, I think one of the
things that quad code does in particular that's really amazing is split up context well. And so if
you look at uh I don't know, things like skills or subagents, like when you ask Claude Code to do
something, it will typically spawn an explore subagent or like multiple ones. And basically each of
those are running haiku to traverse the file system and kind of like explore what's there, and
they're doing it in their own context window. And I think Enthropic has kind of like figured
something out here around given a task. Does that task fit in the context window or should I
actually like split it into many more? And the models are like insanely good at this, which I think
gives them really good results. And I think the fascinating thing is because it's on the terminal is
the purest form for composable atomic integrations, because if you came from uh ID first world,
which is where cursor was and I suppose codex too, this concept of uh finding the context more
freeform wouldn't come out so natural, right? Because you relax that constraint, which is so unique.
Yeah. And I th uh personally I was surprised. I don't know how you all feel, but I was surprised
that like CRIs. It's like a weird retro future. Yes. That like the CLIs, which are the technology
from twenty years ago, have somehow beaten out all the actual IDEs, which were supposed to be the
future. A hundred percent, yeah. And I I think it's important actually to quad code that it's not an
IDE. Because it sort of distances you from the code that's being written. Like IDEs are all about
exploring files, right? And you're like trying to keep all the state in your head and understand
what's going on. But the fact that a CLI is like a totally different thing means that they have a
lot more freedom in terms of how it feels. And I I don't know about you, but I feel like when I'm
using Claude code, it's like, oh, I feel like I'm flying through the code, you know? It's like
there's all sorts of things going, there's like little progress indicators, it's kind of like giving
me status updates, but like the code that's being written is not the front and center thing.

Gary Tan (host): I mean dev environments are so messy. I mean, I really like how clean a sandbox
conceptually is in Codex. But then I just ran into all these crazy issues like trying to do you
know, run just simple testing, right? It needs to access Postgres and then it can't do it, or y you
know, my Codex.md ended up being twenty lines long and even then it didn't work. When it's in your
CLI, it could just access your development database. I mean, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do
this, but I've actually also had it access my production database to and uh it can just do it. It's
like, yeah, okay, here like I looked into it and I think this happened and I'm gonna debug this you
know, concurrency issue. I was like, oh my God, like this thing can debug nested delayed jobs like
five levels in and figure out what the bug was and then write a test for it and it never happens
again. This is insane. Yeah.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): And I think that distribution mode is frankly underrated. Like thinking
about a cursor or a quad code or a codec CLI, the fact that you can just download it and use it
without having to get IT permissions or anything makes a huge difference. And actually I was playing
around with a product the other day where uh you download a desktop app and then it execs the Claude
code that you have running on your laptop and uses that and communicates back via an M C P server to
the desktop product. And it's like this is a very interesting way of now starting to work with your
laptop where you don't have to get anyone's permission to do it. You just download the product and
go.

Gary Tan (host): Yeah, I was looking at like new relic has an MCP, but you know, Sentry you can like
copy markdown, but like it's like an auto bug fixer. Yeah. Basically. It's right there.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): It's super interesting. That in a world where things are changing so
fast, you really want your pride to have a bottoms up distribution, not top down, because like top
down is like just too slow. Like the CTO of a company is gonna be like Have all these concerns about
security and privacy and whether it's a control. Control exactly. Versus like the engineers just
like install the thing and start using it. Like this thing is amazing. Yeah, I think that's right.
The one thing I do struggle with, I mean, I'm like a B2B enterprise guy generally, but I feel like
there's some amount of moat that happens when you do that top down sale. And there's gotta be some
company who manages to crack it where it's like, oh, this is the thing that everyone has access to.
Maybe individual people can take it up.

Gary Tan (host): That was the original um Netscape Navigator. It was free for non commercial use.
And then uh people would just download it and use it for commercial use. And then they could just
track down the IPs and figure out uh exactly how many clients were in all of these different
companies and say, You should pay for this. You're in violation, but all you have to do is buy a
license. Yeah. I'd be curious if you could do that work again here. I mean, th your point about
distribution is very interesting 'cause Uh now people are probably just making architecture
decisions about what to use directly in Claude Code. Like they might not even know what uh you know,
what analytics to use. And it's like, oh yeah, as long as Claude Code says use post hog, like
they're using post hog.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): A hundred percent. One of the companies who I advise was talking about
their like GEO strategy. This is like the generative optimization or how you show up in chatbots.
And what he was saying is funny is one of their competitors had put together a like top five list of
like tools in their category that you should be using. And of course their tool is ranked at the top
of this top five list. And like any human looking at this would be like, Oh, this is so obviously
biased. It's like the top tool is the one that's in the domain, you know? But the LLMs get fooled.
And like they're pulling together a bunch of contacts and they're saying, like, oh, this is the top,
and then they'll just recommend it. I think, yeah, if you're selling a developer tool, like having
good docs that are out there, like having social proof, like Maybe being posted on Reddit a little
bit more, all of that helps your case tremendously. Which one I think a lot of the open source uh
projects have taken off a lot more. I think one of the examples is Supabase actually. Yeah. Yeah. Uh
which really took off last year. And part of it's because they have such a good open source
documentation how to set up a bunch of stuff. Whenever someone asks how to set up anything that you
need, some sort of back end fire base type of transaction, the default answer from all the LMs is
actually uh Supabase. I just trying some of these questions that comes from that.

Gary Tan (host): The thing is it's winning the internet and it was like that before when it was like
Stack Overflow and searching Google and then now that nobody uses Google anymore, it's like crazy.
You just yeah, it's kinda the same deal.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): I I will say it does help open source disproportionately, I would say.
Like I don't know if you all saw there is a ramp blog post that they recently published about
building their own coding agent. And they were mentioning that they use open code as a harness, um,
because the model can look and see the source code and understand how it's working. And I I do this
all the time with open source projects. I'll like clone the repo and then spin up Codex or Quad Code
and be like, Hey, give me a walkthrough of what's going on here and it's really useful. What do you
think are some of the tips for anyone that wants to build a coding agent since you've uh done it a
lot? What are what are some uh now lessons that you learn that you wanna share? I mean, I think the
number one thing uh is managing context well. Basically, we kinda had like a checkpoint for uh I
think it was O three, like one of the reasoning models. And then we did a bunch of fine tuning on it
um in reinforcement learning where it's like, oh, you're given a bunch of questions to like solve
these coding problems or like fix tests or whatever or implement a feature. Um and then the model
was RL'd to respond to those. And so I think most people are not going to be doing that right. But
the things that you can do are figure out like, hey, what context should I be supplying to this
agent to get the best possible result. And so for quad code, if you watch it working, it's like, oh,
I'm going to like spawn a bunch of these explore sub agents. They will like search for different
patterns in the file system. They will come back, uh, they will have this context, they'll summarize
it for me, and then I'll have some place to go. It's interesting watching like different agents
structure this context. Uh like I think Cursor takes an approach where they actually do semantic
search, where they embed everything and figure out like, hey, what query is closest to this. If you
look at a codex or a quad code, uh they actually just use like grep. Uh and I think that works with
code is very context dense. Um like if you think about lines of code, it's like each line is
probably less than 80 characters. There's not a lot of like big like data blobs or like JSON in your
code base. Maybe there's some, but not a lot. You can respect git ignore to figure out and like
filter out stuff that's just not relevant or is like packaged. And you can use grep and rip grep to
like find context around the code, which probably gives you a good sense for what that code is
doing. And you can navigate the file folder structure. And also LMs are really good at emitting very
complicated grep expressions. Yes that would like torture a human.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Yes. Yeah yeah. Yeah. This is like the RL in practice. Yeah. And so I
think all of that like if you're trying to build a system, well, I'm trying to build systems that
integrate uh agents for non coding work. Uh I think you can learn a lot of those lessons and say,
like, hey, how do I get my f data in the format that is like Maybe closest to code, where the model
can like peek and look at like areas around it and get the right structured data. So given this is
how a lot of the superpowers for the best coding agents is context engineering, what are some of the
tips to become a top one percent user of coding agents?

Gary Tan (host): Yeah, what's your stack? Yeah,

Calvin French-Owen (guest): what what do you do to be so productive with it? One is if you're able
to use uh just generally far less code and plumbing. Um so a lot of what I do is like deploy stacks
on like Vercel or Next.js or like Cloudflare workers where there's kind of like already a bunch of
boilerplate like taking care of for you. And then you don't really have to think that much about
like, hey, I need to stand up like all these different services and deal with like service discovery
and like registering on like some sort of central endpoint or like all these databases. It's like,
oh like Everything is pretty roughly defined in this like one or two hundred lines of code. I tend
to operate more towards microservices for that as well, or like individual packages that are fairly
s well structured. I think it's also worth knowing like what the LLM superpowers are. Like in
general, coding agents are uh I think Andrej Karpathy just tweeted about this. They're like super
persistent, so they will keep going no matter what. They end up uh typically just making more of
whatever's there. So if you're trying to direct them to do something, it's worth like I mean, uh I
can pick on OpenAI slightly. In this example, OpenAI has like a giant monorepo. It's been there for
uh a few years now and has like I don't know, thousands of engineers who are committing. Some of
those engineers are like super senior meta folks who came in and are like know exactly how to write
production code. Some are like new PhDs. It's like uh a pretty wide range. And so the LM will pick
up different things depending on where you direct it. I think there's a lot of room actually for
coding agents to figure out like what is the like optimal type of code that we should produce. I
mean, obviously giving the model a way to check its work. helps improve performance drastically. So
the more that you can run tests in Lint, uh, CI, etc., um personally I also use code review bots
pretty aggressively. Um I know like Greptile uh YC company is really good. Um I use the cursor bug
bot has gotten quite good. And I actually like codex for c code review as well. It I find it does a
very good job on correctness. So those are all things that like the agents are good at. Uh and
they're excellent at exploring the code base too. I think areas where they don't do well, uh They
make more if your goal is not to make more, they'll like often duplicate code and like spend a bunch
of time re implementing things that like you're like, Oh, of course you didn't want to do this. I
think context poisoning is a real thing where it kind of like goes down one loop and it will
continue because it has this persistence, but it's referring back to tokens which are like not right
in terms of pursuing a solution. Um and so one thing that I often do is like very actively clear
context. Like how often? Usually uh when it gets above like fifty percent tokens. Oh wow. Yeah,
yeah. I don't there's this guy, Dex uh, from this company, Human Layer, that was actually another YC
company. Yeah, that's YC company from fall twenty four. Yeah, yeah. He talks a lot about it, yeah.
He has this concept of like the LLMs reaching the dumb zone where it's like after a certain amount
of tokens, uh, it just starts like degrading in quality. And I actually think that's very true,
especially if you think about like how the reinforcement learning might work. Like imagine you're a
college student. You're taking an exam, and the first five minutes of that exam, you're like, Oh, I
have all the time in the world. Like I'll do a great job. I'll think through each of these problems.
Let's say you have like five minutes left and you still have half the exam left. You're like, oh
man, I just gotta do whatever I can. Like that's the LM with a context window, right? One of the
tricks that uh I think founders use is you put like a cannery at the beginning of the context.
There's something very it'soteric that it's like. It's like something really funny. It's like, I
don't know, my name is Calvin and blah blah blah. I drink Tea at at eight A. M. s some random fact.
And then as you keep going, you ask it, Do you remember what's my name? Do you remember when I drank
tea? And then when it starts forgetting that, I think is a bit of a sign that it the context has
poison. That's like one trick I see people do. They do a random cannery. I've not tried this, but I
fully believe it.

Gary Tan (host): That's interesting. I haven't run across any bugs before compaction, but maybe I'm
not paying attention. But you're saying like that actually is actively something that it just starts
doing weirder things that are not like optimal. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I gotta be on the lookout for
that. Do your own internal heartbeat around it, around the context.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Yeah. And I think we're just not there yet. Like I agree with you in the
limit. Uh right now it's definitely hard to manage context well. And I think kind of the way it gets
around is like split up context windows and then try and merge everything. But you're sort of still
at the limit right now of like everything that lives in context at the end of a quad code session is
kind of fixed. It's actually interesting. The codex approach is kind of the opposite. Um they just
wrote about this on the OpenAI blog, where it will run compaction like periodically after each turn.
And so Codex can continue to run for a very long time. And if you look at the percentage in the uh
the CLI, you'll see it like move up and down as compaction runs.

Gary Tan (host): I guess like there are these very different architectures between Claude Code and
Codex sound like they're actually deeper in that codex is actually meant for much longer running
jobs. So you know that's sort of like off the bat a different use case, and then the architecture is
very different as a result. I guess right now it seems like CLI is, you know, twenty twenty six
might be the year of CLI. But then this other idea that AGI is here and it's actually ASI is around
the corner. The coding agents right now are really, really smart, but not smart enough to run on
their own for long periods of time. But a 10X increase in compute from here, are we there? Like are
we at twenty-four hours or forty-eight hour running jobs on codecs and that architecture is correct
for that world.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Yeah, I think it's a good question. It sort of goes back to like kind of
the founding DNA of both companies. Like I feel like Anthropic has always been very big on like
building tools for humans where it comes to like, oh, here's the style of the tone and like here's
how it should fit with all of the rest of your work. And I I think Claude Code is like a very
natural extension of that. In a lot of ways it like works like a human would, where it's like, oh,
you need to build like, I don't know, a doghouse or something. It's like, oh, I'll go to the
hardware store and I'll build all these materials and I'll like figure out how they all fit
together. Whereas OpenAI really leans into this idea of just like we are going to train the best
model and reinforce over time and get it to do longer and longer horizon things in this pursuit of
artificial general intelligence. And so it may not work like a human at all, like going back to the
doghouse example, it's like

Gary Tan (host): AlphaGo didn't either. Yeah, but AlphaGo

Calvin French-Owen (guest): didn't either. It's like, oh, it's like instead I will have a 3D printer
that can print from scratch like a doghouse and it will be exactly what you want, and it will take a
long time and it will be like very custom and it will do like weird things, but it will work, you
know, and like maybe in the limit that's the right call. And so it's gonna be really interesting to
see how they play out.

Gary Tan (host): I mean net net it seems like the latter is somewhat inevitable, but I like the
former so much. Yes. Yeah, yeah. I like you know, like even this idea that it greps was like I
thought about, you know, ten years ago it was like, yeah, I was in there like writing my own really
weird regexes to try to figure out where everything was when I was refactoring or whatever, trying
to understand code or whatever. So that's the feeling I get when I'm using it. It's like I can do
five people's worth of work in like a single day. It's like rocket boosters. It's just unbelievable.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): I think it's going to be really interesting to see how this plays out
across large and small companies. Like I think everyone who's experimenting with this stuff on like
a hobbyist level or at like a very small startup They're just pushing the coding agents as far as
they can go. Because it's like you don't really have time to figure out anything else. Like as a
startup you have limited runway. You're just going to like orient around speed. I think at a bigger
company you have a lot more to lose. And you have all these other internal processes around code
review and you probably already hired like a big edge team. And I think it's gonna be very strange
as like these individual teams of like one person are like, Hey, that team over there isn't doing
the right thing. Like, let me just build a prototype that like works better. I think at some point
it's going to start working better. And I think that landscape shift is going to be a very
interesting, strange thing.

Gary Tan (host): My ten year old is uh you know, he he has uh writing assignments every day. And
then yesterday was the first day where he used AI. And then I was like, This is not a turn of a
phrase that a ten year old is capable of doing. And then I think about that in this context because
we, you know, are working with a lot of eighteen to twenty two year olds who you know, they've done
internships, but like they haven't done like end manager work, like or you know, we're saying Um,
you know, post product market fit. Uh, once you have job cues of like millions of jobs and like, you
know, hundreds of thousands of errors, that's like real end management. Like that's really you know,
it's horribly unglamorous like combing through hundreds of thousands of errors and then like
manually making sure that like the thing works for all of your users in the background. How does the
next generation understand that? Can the Claude Code bot actually teach people about uh architecture
and things like that? Or, you know, are you just gonna bump your head into it and users just kinda
suffer and, you know, people have to figure it out?

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Like at least where I f find myself spending the most time when it comes
to product is figuring out the kind of product model in a sense. Like what are the things that the
user has to understand today? Um and what are the primitives that they can use to like do whatever
they want? I always think of Slack like this. It's like Slack was in some ways not really a new
concept. It's like there were many chats that existed before it. Um but the fact that they had like
channels, messages and reactions in a simple way that people could just like think about and be
like, oh I understand how to like navigate this. It made a lot of sense for people. But then kind of
once they were there, like it's very hard to change that later on for a user, you know? It's like,
oh, maybe they wanted to go in more of like a document first way, or like maybe right now they're
trying to incorporate agents. It's like difficult to change the user's mental model. And so I at
least for myself building products, it's like you have to think about that very carefully from an
early stage, 'cause again, whatever you supply to the coding agents as that kind of kernel is going
to be what they run with and make more of forevermore.

Gary Tan (host): YC's next batch is now taking applications. Got a startup in you? Apply at
ycombinator.com/apply. It's never too early, and filling out the app will level up your idea. Okay,
back to the video. Do you have

Calvin French-Owen (guest): thoughts just because you know the the agent so well? Like what what
types of engineers are going to benefit more than others um from these tools plu becoming popular?
In general, I think that kind of the more senior senior you are, the more you benefit. Um, because
the agents are so good at taking some sort of idea and then putting it into action. If you're able
to prompt that in a few words, it's kind of like, oh, now suddenly I had this like idea. And I I
find this so often in OpenAI, like strolling through the code base. It's like, oh, like here's a
thing that I wish were different. Here's the thing that I wish were different. Here's the thing that
I wish were different. Like just being able to kick those off and then have them come back, I think
is super empowering and multiplies your impact. I think also being able to detect like which sorts
of changes are good or bad architecturally is very important, or like have a sense for where you
might want to flag something to an agent. I think engineers who are more organized, like manager-
ish, uh and there's probably just a missing product to be built here. Uh maybe uh something like
conductor, uh, where it's like Spread across all of your sessions and kind of reminding you like,
hey, you were working on this thing, it's done, it needs your input here. Oh, you should switch your
attention over to this other thing. I think that is where you're talking about.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Yes, a hundred percent. Yeah. I mean, I want like when I wake up every
day, it kind of is like, Hey, here's all the work that got done overnight. Like here are the like
three decisions that you need to make. Here are like areas of deep thinking that you are planning to
do. Like I want the turn by turn for my day, you know? Other things that make it very useful, like
if you're able to build um, I don't know, some sort of like quick prototype for an idea to show it
off, like that's an area. I mean, obviously the agents do super well at this. Um I would find myself
at OpenAI often writing kind of like prototype code or like, hey, I've got this like in memory key
value store, can you now turn it into like uh work with a production database or something like
that, being able to concisely specify ideas and code? And then I think having a smell for what the
right architecture is is still the area where the models like don't do the best job. So if you were
going back to your like college days and studying C S again fresh and you like were picking your own
like syllabus or curriculum, like what would you what would you study? Personally I think still
understanding systems uh is very important. Um and just having some conception of like how like Git
works, you know, or like HTTP or databases, like Qs, like all of these different systems. I think
that those fundamentals are still quite important. The other thing that I'd probably do is just have
a semester where like each week you're just building something and you really try and push the
models as far as they can go. There's this sense that you have whenever you're doing something that
you could always just like go up the layer and ask the model to do it, and like go up a layer and
ask the model to do it. You know, where it's like, oh, I have like a implement command where it like
implements the next phase of the plan, but then I could have like an implement all command and it
like goes stage by stage and creates a new sub agent. And then I could have like a Check your work
kind of thing and like and I think knowing where the models can and can't accomplish that is such a
moving target that it's worthwhile just to like tinker a lot.

Gary Tan (host): I mean the other thing that's really really crazy for I mean, I would love to be
able to teach eighteen to twenty two year olds. Like everyone around like at this table has like
ship stuff that people really, really want and love. So it's like, how do we teach people that?

Calvin French-Owen (guest): I wonder if like the best eighteen to twenty two year olds like five
years from now will just have like off the charts taste and everything. Because they'll just be so
much more prolific. They should be, right? Like they should just be launching and like touching
reality like ten times as much as like the generation before them. The one thing I have wondered
about on that note, um I don't know if you all found this, but growing up my mom used to tell me
like, Oh, like, stop multitasking. You're not paying attention to like what I'm doing. Uh and I
think there is some truth to that. Like often I would be like off on my computer, like not paying
attention. But I do think I was l legitimately better at multitasking than our parents were. Uh and
now I look at this new generation, I think they're actually quite a bit better at multitasking than
we are, you know, because they've kind of grown up in this age of the internet and they're dealing
with like TikTok and all these like different short form video and things. Like it seems like
there's room for both kind of this like deep thinking where you want to like notice what you're
seeing and understand and problem solve. But then there's also this mode of just like bounce between
a bunch of different things and you're context switching constantly. That's like PhD mode. Yeah. The
new generation is quite good at this. Yes. I definitely think there's a there's a type of smart
person, maybe it's ADHD, but just like always has like a bunch of good projects on the go, but just
never actually finishes anything. I might relate to this personality a little bit. Um Hey,

Gary Tan (host): you release your uh your Claude code. Yeah, but

Calvin French-Owen (guest): I wouldn't only because of Claude code. That's kind of my point. Like
now I just think like you kind of like there's certain types of brains that just have like like ten
branches going in their heads, but you never have enough hours in the day to actually like see any
of them through. So they're always like half complete. And now it's just like Claude code gets you
over the line with everything. And it's just like and you made this point in your blog post about
how it feels like a video game, but it's just like there's just a constant novelty factor. Like you
start working on something and usually when you hit the point of like, I'm like bored and I've got
like this other better idea and I should like start on that and then come back to this, like you can
do that now, but like everything can actually get finished.

Gary Tan (host): Let's live in the future for a moment. It's forty years from now. Software still
exists, databases still exist. Access control still exists. But like at the core of it, I mean,
software is entirely personal. Access control and who gets to do it is like, you know, sort of like
this manager mode thing that people still have meetings about. But then everything else about a
company, its functions, its roles, like is defined by people just doing things in their own Claude
code like thing. I don't know. Maybe it's a CLI or it's like, you know, having giant armies of
workers then. I don't know. What would that look like? Like

Calvin French-Owen (guest): imagine if every time a company signed up for segment, you fork the code
base, you give them their own copy of segment it's running on their own servers. And then if they
want to change anything about it, they just like tell some chat window which is running like an
agenda coding loop and it just like edits their version of segment as segment the corporation pushes
out more features, some agent figures out how to merge. Yeah, I I could totally see it. I mean sort
of what I've been thinking I don't know how far this future is, but like eventually every person
who's working like has their own sort of like cloud computer and like set of cloud agents who are
running for them. And they're mostly just like talking back and forth. It's kind of like having like
a super EA or something where it's like, oh, here are the things I need to pay attention to. Like
let me make some quick decisions, like let me spend more time on this. Let me like meet with other
people. Cause I think that there's still going to be room for people who are like want to meet other
people and exchange ideas in person, or at least I get a lot of a moment out of that.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): And then separately there's going to be this army of agents who are like
doing things on your behalf and like automating a bunch of things. Uh I think the average company is
probably going to get like a little smaller and there's going to be many more of them doing more
things. Something I'm curious to see is kind of like what the update version of the PG maker uh
maker schedule versus manager schedule would look like. 'Cause I feel like part of what's going on
at Y C is sort of a lot of our jobs are essentially manager schedule, which are just really made it
hard to do any sort of building your own software. But now you totally can. And that's why like a
bunch of the partners

Gary Tan (host): do it in the meeting. Like I like right at the beginning of this podcast.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): You let it run and then come back. Well like in the pockets, right? Like
in like it just used to be like literally unless you had like, you know, four hours minimum block
free to do something, it just wasn't worth even getting started, right? And I I think that's
actually goes very deep to how we've changed programming. Like it used to be that in order to write
any code, you had to fill your own context window with so much data about all the different class
names and the functions and the code that it touches. It would take hours to build up that context
window. And so doing it in ten minute snatches was just like so frustrating. I do think maybe one
one primitive for this future world will be I think still the data models need to be still be
consistent and the system of record. But imagine something that generates all the data that you need
for all the different views for custom software. So a lot of the world would be custom views. But I
think the unify stuff, we still need to have the data to be correct. I think data has a lot of
gravity. And I think you see this with companies who are like offering access via API or MCP. Like I
think Slack uh locked down their API a little bit because they didn't want people just exfiltrating
everything from Slack and then building a gentic experiences on top of it. I wonder with that note,
if you were to rebuild segment in the current with the current tools, how would it look like? I
mean, uh segment is a a funny business in that uh where we started was building these integrations,
right? Um and so it's like, oh, you need to wire up like the same data going to like mix panel and
kismetrics and Google Analytics, et cetera. And I think just writing that code now, like that used
to be maybe a more annoying or harder thing to do, and so it was worth paying for. Now it like that
value has dropped to zero. One top. Yeah. And actually, like in many cases, you're better off like
saying, Oh, I actually want to map it this way and I want the specific behavior. Like I'll just tell
the quad or codex what to do, and then it will do it, and I'll have exactly the behavior that I
want. So I think that aspect of segment, like the value has dropped precipitously. I think the
aspect of like keeping this data pipeline running and like continuing to automate a bunch of parts
of your business or like schedule these like email deliveries which should go out through customer
IO every time a customer signs up or like manage audiences for you, like that value is kind of still
there. And I think you could do a lot more interesting things where it's like, hey, if I have all
this data and like a full view of the customer, like How should I be emailing them? Should I change
like parts of the product when they log in? Should I be giving them different onboardings depending
on who they are? Like there's a lot more interesting stuff that you could do by basically running
like, I don't know, small LM agents over them and changing that. That would be the changes I would
make. So it's kinda like moving up the stack to your comment earlier and all the way turtles down.
The low level stuff is gone. Is now really more doing things at the campaign level, which is way
more abstract.

Gary Tan (host): Yes. I mean I'm amazed at to what degree like Claude code, even just from like the
context of what I'm working on, figures out like what my motivations are.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Yeah. I I I'm still blown away by coding agents because effectively what
you're doing is you're like giving them a copy of a repo and then you're slipping a little note
under the door and being like, Hey, go implement this thing. They have like no knowledge of like
what your company is or like what you do, who your customers are. In most cases, maybe it's in the
training set 'cause they know you're Gary. Garry it blows my mind that it works at all. And and
that's where I think the context is really important, right? Because if it latches onto something
that isn't quite right, it doesn't have a lot to go on. And if it misses something that's essential,
it's going to just re implement it.

Gary Tan (host): What do you think the constraints are right now? I mean, like context window is
still a constraint, but it's like so big that you know, it's like we can do some stuff. Like we
can't do the mega re architectures, but we can do a lot and then if the Opus four point five somehow
got a lot smarter Uh and then that unlocked a big thing, which was interesting. I don't have no idea
if that was like pre-training or post-training. Like what are there other like m levers that you
think of other than you know basic model intelligence, like frontier model intelligence and context
window?

Calvin French-Owen (guest): I mean, I still think context window is like probably the number one
limit. Like if you look at Claude code executing, it's delegating to all these different context
windows. At the end of the day, when each one comes back, it's like getting some sort of summary. So
it's also not getting the full picture. Like if you have a problem that's just like too big to fit
in a single one, you like kind of no amount of compaction is going to help you. I would point to
that as like both Anthropic has figured something quite useful out with delegating to these
subcontext windows, but also I think it's still a block barrier.

Gary Tan (host): So we'd do better if we had a million co million token context context every single
time.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Yeah, I think so. And like figure it out a better way to especially
train these like very long context trajectories. Because if you think about it, like there's there's
a lot of training data on the internet for like what is the next sentence that comes or like what's
the next paragraph that comes. If you have

Calvin French-Owen (guest): 80,000 tokens that are generated, like understanding what the next thing
to do based upon like, oh, I should refer to the twenty thousand token, like that's trickier. I
think this like integration and orchestration is starting to become the limiting factor. I mean, I I
think there are like stuff on code review related to this. It's like, oh, if we're like merging all
this code, like who's watching it? Does a human still have to watch it? Like, how do we verify the
changes? And then I think like pulling in the context correctly from your tools, like you were
talking about sentry. Like you want sentry to auto be able to like figure out a PR, you know, and
then like maybe it pushes it to a subset of your traffic and if it looks good then it rolls out
everywhere, you know? Like all that automation stuff has to be built.

Gary Tan (host): I was surprised how important testing was. Like I was operating for like the first
two or three days of my nine days in the wilderness, like uh no tests or very few tests and then one
day I was like, All right, today's refactor day, I'm gonna do get to a hundred percent test coverage
and then I just sped up like crazy. It was like, Oh, it did it, it works. I d rarely even have to
necessarily manually test 'cause it's like the test coverage is so good and like nothing breaks.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Which is very similar to what all the companies are doing just for
prompt engineering n outside of coding is very much test driven development. I think we had this
episode with Jake Heller and that was a big paradigm shift. It's like the way you get a good prompt
is all test driven, just like e balls, right? In a sense, the test cases are your e balls.

Gary Tan (host): There are some broken flows now. I think that you mu we might need a uh Claude Code
that could like talk to a stack overflow that was like a Claude Code stack overflow. Like I had this
problem that was so crazy. Like I uh instead of using in the in like the priority of a job queue, I
used or actually I didn't even write again, I did not write this. The machine wrote a string with a
comma thinking that it would take that syntax, but it was expecting like an array in JSON. And then
it just like no jobs would run. And then I watched it for like 30 minutes walk through the internals
of Rails job like the active job, like a couple thousand lines of code, like trying to debug what
was happening. And it found the bug, actually. I was like, that's amazing. I just think about what I
would do like ten years ago and I would have been like, Hey, why are the, you know, jobs not
working? And then I would find a Stack Overflow or blog po a Rails blog post and it's like, Oh yeah,
like nobody fixed that stupid bug where, you know, you think that you can put a you know, comma
delimited string in there, but actually you have to make sure it's an array. Uh-huh. He's like, oh
my God. Like that was ri very funny actually. I think that's like one of the hardest parts about
thinking about what's going to happen here, because uh there's like things that you would do as a
human in a CLI right now, and like that's very obvious. But even that idea of like, should the
agents have their own Stack Overflow, like if you just increase the intelligence by, you know, I
don't know what you even call it, like by ten IQ points, like ten virtual IQ points. Like, would it
even do that? It would just be like, oh yeah, that's a string, whatever. Yeah,

Calvin French-Owen (guest): yeah. I think there's something very interesting here around like agent
memory. Um and Claude Code has sort of set itself up, and I think Codex 2 by storing all your
conversation history just as files. So you could imagine you like give it access to a tool that then
can read previous conversation history. I think there's a missing piece around a lot of
collaboration there. Like it'd be amazing if like There was some way of smartly sharing your
coworkers' prompts and you could see and be like, oh, like I hit this thing, but actually like Brian
over there like fixed it earlier, you know, so like the two of us can share knowledge. I I think
there's something you're s something onto this of like a model generated like wiki, you know, or
like Gracopedia style. Now I can't stop thinking about have you seen um the Claudot social net like
the network for ClaudeBots to talk to each other? And it's like yeah. That's the evolution for
Moltenbot. Yeah, but I guess for those who don't know, ClaudeBot's essentially like um uh like your
own personal AI agent that you can run on your own machine. You can download it. Um do not give it
access to emails would be my number one piece of advice. Well probably anything. Um, because it's
not clear how safe it is, and it's probably almost certainly gonna probably a lot of people being
prompt injected by it right now. But somebody created um Instead of like a website, I haven't
actually seen it, but I've just like seen it on Twitter. But like a site where like everyone can
sort of spin up their own like Claude bot, their personal agent, and then the agents can talk to
each other. And now there's just like all this AI generated content of these like personal AI agents
talking to each other. Yeah. I mean it looks like Reddit, but if Reddit were run by agents. I mean
it it's interesting to see like Codex's personality shine through when writing code, I would say. Uh
it does most stuff that humans don't do, kind of in this alpha go sense, where it's like, oh, it'll
write a Python script to like modify some part of the file system. I think that is like very
interesting and kind of alien behavior, which has been programmer would not do that. Um but it does
give these like superhuman results for me at least when debugging complex issues that I find Opus
often misses.

Gary Tan (host): What's an example of a complex issue that you could talk about? I mean, it's like
concurrency or naming issues, right?

Calvin French-Owen (guest): I find the models are actually like decent at concurrency. Oftentimes
there's stuff where it's like, oh, there's a request that is like traversing several different
services. Uh I mean, kinda to your point about the uh serialization and deserialization of like
stuff with commas in it. Um it's like, oh, it needs to track some sort of complex behavior around
those or like way of uh I don't know, refreshing complex UI state and Opus often will miss it if
there's many files, but Codex seems to catch it. Interesting. Yeah.

Gary Tan (host): Yeah. Prognostication about how will tools continue to evolve. It's a very
interesting like I feel like sort of a new citizen in this land in a way. Like I just, you know,
knew it was happening. I, you know, manager schedule. Finally a project appeared and was like, oh,
I'm gonna go all in on this. And then now I'm like in it's like uh I'm in a stranger in a strange
land. But it but it like resembles exactly what I remember. I think we all

Calvin French-Owen (guest): feel awesome. We all feel that way. Yeah. Like I think I think the most
important thing is just to keep tinkering because it all changes every few months. I do feel like
the best or the people who will get the most out of coding agents in the future are going to be kind
of like more manager like, where they're focusing on directing flows in certain ways. They're
probably going to be a little bit more like designer artist in some ways, where it's like they're
figuring out what specifically goes in the product and what stuff you can do without. And I think
they'll be very good at just like continuing to think about automation and where they're missing
context.

Gary Tan (host): I guess what's funny is I tried to use Codex just now uh for my Rails project. But
the thing is like it's kind of obvious that Nobody at OpenAI cares about Rails, which is fine. Like
it's a very it's a vestigial language. It's very strange. It just happened to be the one that I, you
know, really, really went deep on ten years ago. And then uh it's just funny how much of it is
exactly again, anyone can make something, but then the something people want. is very hard. And um
even when you have like unlimited resources at like an open AI, it's like I guess if someone from
Codex is watching right now, my request would be go down the list of all of the runtimes and just
add like syntactic sugar. There's like this is probably like, you know, ten PRs at most. for like, I
don't know, the top like fifteen runtimes. I guess it's like sort of the reminder that like, man,
actually like there are vi far fewer excuses for software that doesn't quite work for a user, you
know, now than ever, actually.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Yeah. I do think it this is an interesting point in terms of mix of
training data. Codex works very well on Python monorepos imaging. It sounds like the shape of
OpenAI. Yeah, yeah. And it's like I remember working like internally at OpenAI, I was like, oh my
gosh, this tool is amazing. It is incredible. Um and it kind of makes sense in terms of the data mix
and the researchers who are working on it. I think Enthropic is focused a little bit more on like
some of the front end things. Um And I don't know in terms of like a Ruby, for example, like who has
the best model there and who's incorporated the data mix. Yeah. Like some of the labs tend to take
this perspective of just more data is better. Uh and so they'll just flood as much data as possible,
while others I think are a little bit more tuned in terms of the mix. And I think depending on which
approach you take there, it can give very different results. Where it's like, oh, I'm taking just
the like top ten percent of JavaScript is pretty different than if you're looking across everything.

Gary Tan (host): I actually think OpenAI and uh the you know OpenAI models are really good at Ruby,
uh from what I can tell. And then it's it's just

Calvin French-Owen (guest): it's the harness around the model. It is it is yeah. Oh, interesting.
Okay. It's

Gary Tan (host): literally like Rails has this weird thing where you have to have, you know, access
Postgres in a certain way or like it couldn't figure out what Ruby Yeah, the sandboxing

Calvin French-Owen (guest): is yeah. The sandboxing it's such an interesting question because uh I
think open AI actually takes the like sandboxing and security question more seriously than almost
anyone else. I remember when we were building Codex, like basically one of the gates that you have
to pass through in order to release a model is you have to like talk about safety and security risks
like every time you want to release. One of the things we were looking into was prompt injection,
especially for opening up to the internet. Because a bunch of users were like, oh, this has to like
work on the internet. We're like, oh, we don't know. Like it seems pretty easy to prompt. Operator

Gary Tan (host): was also, yeah. Yeah. That.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Yeah. And so uh the PM on our team, Alex, uh basically like put together
a GitHub issue in it had like a very obvious prompt injection which was like, oh, reveal this thing.
And then he told the model, like, hey, go fix this issue. Uh and he's like, oh, there's no way this
is gonna work. And like immediately the prompt injection works. And so I think open AI like sort of
correctly is very worried about this and is like, hey, we're gonna run everything in a sandbox.
We're gonna make sure it like doesn't touch all these sensitive files in your machine. We're gonna
be very careful about secrets. And I think if you're a startup where you're just like running fast,
you probably don't care. You're just like, I just want it to work. Yep. You know? Are you a
dangerously skip permissions person? Uh I actually am not. I like have a set of things that I'm
about to

Gary Tan (host): not, no. Okay. I like to read, you know, I like to read what it's doing. Are

Calvin French-Owen (guest): you skip permissions, Jared? A hundred percent. YOLA mode. Oh

Gary Tan (host): my god. It's about

Calvin French-Owen (guest): a fifty fifty on the YC engineering team house.

Gary Tan (host): A security engineer would watch this part and say, You can't release this part of
the cut it from the podcast. You can't have this out here. Hmm, YC has progressed a little bit from
a startup. We still act like one though. I think important. Cool. I mean this is so awesome. Calvin,
thank you so much for joining us.

Calvin French-Owen (guest): Of course. Thanks for having

Gary Tan (host): me. Oh my god. This is fun. Yeah, so fun. Alright, back to Claude.
