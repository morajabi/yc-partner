## Transcript

Host: One of the things that I think is true for any startup is you have to keep proving yourself.
Every single insight that we have is a depreciating insight. You look at a company like Nvidia. If
Nvidia doesn't innovate in the next two years, AMD will be on their case. That's why I'm completely
okay with a lot of our insights being wrong. If we don't continually have insights that we are
executing on, we are just slowly dying. This notion of just a developer is probably going to broaden
out to what's called a builder. And I think everyone is going to be a builder. I think software is
going to be this very, very democratized thing.

Host: Welcome back to another episode of the Light Cone. Today we've got a real treat. We have the
co-founder and CEO of Windsurf, one of the people who literally brought Vibe Coding into existence,
Verun. Thanks for joining us.

Verun: Thanks for having me, guys.

Host: Where is Windsurf now? I mean, all of us intuitively know. Well, we use it, but you know, how
big is it now? Where is it?

Verun: Yeah, so the product has had well over a million developers kind of use the product. It has
hundreds of thousands of daily active users right now. It's being used for all sorts of things from
modifying large code bases to building apps extremely quickly, zero to one. And we're super excited
to see where the technology is going.

Host: Let's get to the brass tacks. How did you get started?

Verun: The company actually started four years ago. We didn't start as Windsurf. We actually started
as a company called Exofunction. We were a GPU virtualization company at the time. Previously, me
and my co-founder had worked on autonomous vehicles and AR/VR, and we believe deep learning was
going to transform many industries—from financial services to defense to healthcare—many industries.
Yeah, we might have timed it wrong though. Ultimately, we built a system to make it easier to run
these deep learning workloads, similar to what VMware does for computers and CPUs. We did that for
GPUs. In the middle of 2022 though, what happened at the time was we were managing upwards of 10,000
GPUs for a handful of companies, and we had made it to a couple million in revenue. But the
Transformer became very popular with these models, like Text Da Vinci from OpenAI, and we felt that
that was going to fundamentally disrupt the business we had, or that small business that we had at
the time. Because we felt that everyone was going to run these Transformer-type models, and in a
world in which everyone was going to run one type of model architecture—Transformers—we thought if
we were a GPU infrastructure provider, we would get commoditized, right? If everyone's going to do
the same thing, what is our alpha going to be? So at the time, we basically said, hey, could we take
our technology and wholesale pivot the company to do something else? And that's that's scary.

Host: Yeah, that was a bet the company moment.

Verun: We did it within a weekend. So, you know, over the weekend, me and my co-founder had a
conversation along the lines of, "I don't think this is going to work. We don't think we know how to
scale this company." At the time, we were early adopters of GitHub Copilot. We told the rest of the
company on Monday, and everyone started working on Codium, which is the extension product, the
Monday immediately after.

Host: I'm just curious to dig into this pivot story because it's pretty rare actually to hear the
details of a pivot, especially a late-stage pivot like at the time that you guys decided to pivot to
Codium. How far along was the company? How many people?

Verun: One of the things about the company was, I guess, like we tried to embrace a lot of the YC
sort of analogies here—you know, ramen profitability, all these other key insights. We were only a
team of eight people at the time, even though we were making a couple million in revenue. We were
kind of free cash flow positive. It was the peak of zero interest rate at that time. So the company
was a year and a half old. We had raised somehow magically $28 million of cash at the time. And I
think the big point here, in our minds, was that it doesn't matter if we're doing kind of well now
if we didn't know how to scale it. We kind of need to change things really fast.

Host: I guess the thing that's remarkable is when you started the company, you had this thesis where
you were betting that a lot of companies were going to build their own custom deep learning
pipelines to train birds, right? That was like the thing that was working. But in 2022, you saw the
hockey stick shift that suddenly there would be one model that would rule them all. So you were
foreshadowing a lot of the future, and there's a lot of it that came from that conviction. So I'm
curious what were those signs? Because you had to be really embedded into it to—we're making already
seven figures. You could have raised a Series A. You're like we're going to throw all that away and
burn it.

Verun: Yeah. So actually, even crazily enough, we had raised our Series A at that time. So whether
or not we should have been able to is a different question.

Host: No, I think you're totally right.

Verun: I think one of the things that was happening at the time was we were working with largely
these autonomous vehicle companies because they had the largest sort of deep learning workloads at
the time, and we were sort of seeing, hey, that workload is growing and it's large. But we were
betting fundamentally that the other workloads—which were these other natural language workloads,
kind of like these workloads in these other industries like financial services, healthcare—would
take off. But I think once we saw these generative models handle so many of the use cases right,
maybe an example is in the past you would train a BERT model to actually go ahead and do sentiment
classification. But very quickly when we tried even a bad version of GPT-3—like the very old
version—we were like, "This is going to kill sentiment classification. There's no reason why anyone
is going to train a very custom model anymore for this task." I think we saw the writing on the wall
that our hypothesis was just wrong, right? And that's like one of those things, right? You go in
with some thesis on where you believe the space is going to go, but if your hypothesis is wrong and
the information on the ground changes, you have to change really fast.

Host: So then what did you decide to do? So it's like you decided, okay, we're going to pivot. And
when we work with founders, that's kind of stage one. So you're not half foot in, half foot out. So
you had that conviction we need to try something out. How do you figure out what was going to be the
next step?

Verun: I think we needed to pick something that actually everyone at the company was going to be
excited about. I think if we had picked something that was what we thought could be valuable but
people were not excited about, we would ultimately fail. We'd fail immediately. We came with an
opinionated stance of we were early adopters of a product called GitHub Copilot. We thought that
that was the tip of the iceberg on where the technology could go. Obviously, everyone at the company
was a developer. Dev tool companies generally speaking usually don't do that well in the past. They
have not. But hey, like when you have no other options, it's a very easy decision, right? Like
you're going to be a zero with a high probability anyways. You might as well pick something that you
think could be valuable and everyone's going to be motivated to work on.

Host: Everyone's forgot this now, it feels like, because GitHub Copilot's in the background. But at
that particular moment, it felt inevitable that Copilot was going to win, right? Like it just had
everything—like the GitHub connection, Microsoft distribution, like OpenAI, OpenAI, yeah. Like it
would, it seemed like no one could compete. So how did you have like the bravery to be like, ah
yeah, we can totally crush yeah Copilot?

Verun: Yeah, so this is where there's like an irrational optimism piece. I've said this before, but
to the company. But I think startups require like two distinct beliefs, and they actually kind of
run counter to each other. You need this irrational optimism because if you don't have the optimism,
you just won't do anything. You're just a pessimist and a skeptic, and those people don't really
accomplish anything in life. And you need uncompromising realism, which is that when the facts
change, you actually change your mind, right? And that's a very hard thing to do both because the
thing that makes you succeed through irrational optimism, you know, is exactly opposite to the
things that allow you to be a very realistic company. So irrational optimism—we basically said, hey,
we know how to run and train models ourselves. We actually trained the first autocomplete models
ourselves and ran it on our product, gave it out for free. I don't think we had the exact roadmap on
where this was going, but we just felt there was a lot more to do here. And if we couldn't do it,
then I guess we'd die. But we might as well bet that we could do it.

Host: Were your early versions better than GitHub Copilot at the time?

Verun: So our earliest version that we shipped out was materially worse than GitHub Copilot. The
only difference was it was free. We built a VS Code extension after the pivot. Within, I think, two
months, we had shipped the product and given it out to Hacker News—like posted something on Hacker
News. And we built that out. It was missing a lot of key features. The model that we were running
was like an open-source model that was not nearly as good as the model that GitHub Copilot was
running. Very quickly then, our training infrastructure got better. So we actually went out and
trained our own models based on the task, and then suddenly it actually got capabilities that even
GitHub Copilot didn't within two months—basic capabilities. Now we'd find this like hilarious that
it was even state-of-the-art, but our model could actually fill in the middle of code. So when
you're writing code, you're not only just adding code at the end of your cursor, but you're filling
it in between two parts, between two parts of a line, right? And that code is very incomplete and
looks nothing like the training data of these original models, right? So we trained our models to
make it actually very, very capable for that use case. And that actually allowed us to pull ahead in
terms of the quality, latency. We were able to control a lot of details within a couple months. So
the beginning of 2023, I'd say the autocomplete capabilities were much better than what Copilot had.

Host: Was that a totally new capability for you guys? Because like you guys have been building GPU
infrastructure. It sounds like you basically hacked together the first version by taking an off-the-
shelf open-source model, sticking it into like a VS Code extension, and just kind of wiring the two
to like talk to each other. But then right after that, you had to train your own coding model like
from scratch. And you guys have been like following the Transformer stuff, but like you hadn't built
it. Like in order to do that, I assume you had to like download all of GitHub and like train a whole
model from scratch. How did you all figure out how to do that in like only two months?

Verun: Yeah, it's a great question. So first of all, when we ran the model ourselves, the reason why
we were able to run it and provide it for free is we actually had our own inference runtime at the
time, and that obviously came from the fact that we were originally a GPU virtualization company to
start with. So that enabled us to actually ship the v-zero with an open-source product quite
quickly. Immediately after that, you're totally right. We had never trained a model like this in the
past. But I think we hired people that were smart, capable, and excited to win. We needed to figure
it out. There is no other option, right? Otherwise you die. That makes the decision-making really,
really simple. So yeah, we had to figure out how do you get a lot of data? How do you do this at
scale? How do you clean this data? How do you make it so that it's actually capable of handling this
case where code is very incomplete? And we shipped a model like very, very quickly after that.

Host: Wow. And you did all of that with like eightish people in two months.

Verun: Yeah, that's right.

Host: And then right after that, because you were running your own models, you started getting
interesting customers, right?

Verun: Yeah. So basically what happened—the product was free at the time. So we ended up getting a
lot of developers using the product across all the IDEs, so VS Code, JetBrains, Eclipse, Vim.
Companies started reaching out because they not only wanted to run the product in a secure way, they
also wanted to personalize it to all the private data inside the company. So very quickly
afterwards, in the next coming months, companies like Dell, JP Morgan Chase started to become
customers of our product. Now these companies have like tens of thousands of developers on the
product internally. But we started actually making a lot of focus of the company—making sure that
the product works on these very large code bases. Some of these companies have code bases that are
well over a hundred million lines of code, right? And making sure that the suggestions are fast is
one thing, but making sure it's actually personalized to the codebase and the environment that they
have was almost a requirement at the time.

Host: You did that pivot, you built it in two months, then shipped it, and within a couple months,
you got these big logos.

Verun: Yeah. So I mean, obviously these companies take some time to close, but pilots were starting
within like a couple months or a quarter after that. And you know, obviously we had no sales people
at the company, so like the founding team was just trying to run as many pilots as possible to see
what would ultimately work.

Host: At what point did you expand beyond just the VS Code extension into supporting all these other
IDEs?

Verun: That was actually very, very soon afterwards.

Host: How did you think about that? Like, you know, there's like one argument that you could make,
which is like there's lots of VS Code developers. You had a tiny team. You could have made the
argument that I just focus on building a great experience for VS Code. You'd only captured a tiny
percentage of the market of all possible VS Code developers, and that that's not what you did. You
expanded like horizontally very quickly and built extensions for all those IDEs. Why?

Verun: I think maybe the fundamental reason that we thought was quite critical is if we were going
to work with companies, companies have developers that write in many languages. Like, for instance,
like you know a company like JP Morgan Chase might have over half of their developers writing in
Java, and for those developers they are going to use JetBrains and IntelliJ. IntelliJ is—over
seventy to eighty percent of all Java developers in the world currently use IntelliJ right now. So
we would just need to turn away a lot of companies. A lot of companies would not be able to use us
as the de facto solution. Like we'd be one of many solutions inside the company. So because of that,
we made the decision. But luckily, because we made the decision early enough, it changed the
architecture of how we built the product out, which is to say we are not like building a separate
version of the product for every single IDE. We have a lot of shared infrastructure that actually
lives on a per-editor basis. So it's actually a very, very small amount of code that actually needs
to get written to...

Verun: Make sure we can support as many IDs as possible. Um, so this is one of those things that an
early decision that we made ended up making it much easier to make this transition.

Host: How about the transition from Kodium to Windsurf?

Verun: At the time we, you know, now we're probably going to middle of 2023. We start working with
some very large enterprises. Within the next year, like the business has gotten well over sort of
eight figures in revenue, just from these enterprises using the product, and we have this like free
individual product. But I think one of the things about this industry that we all kind of know is
the space moves really, really fast, and uh we basically are always making bets on things that are
not working right. Actually, most of the bets we make in the company don't work, and I'm excited, uh
when I'm like happy when we are, when we're let's say only 50% of the things we're doing are
actually working, because I think when if a 100% of the things we're doing uh are working, um I
think like it's a very bad sign for us because it's probably like one of maybe three things.

Um, the first thing it is is like hey, we're not trying hard enough. Uh right, that's that's
probably what it means. The second thing is we somehow have a lot of hubris, right, and the hubris
is like we believe everything we do is right even despite the facts that are that are sort of on the
ground. And then um, the sort of third key piece is here is we're not actually testing our
hypotheses in a way that like tells us where the future is going. We're not actually at the frontier
of what the capabilities and technology um ultimately is.

We believed actually in the very beginning of last year that agents were going to be extremely huge,
and we had prototypes of this in the beginning of last year, and and they just didn't work. But
there were different pieces we were building that we felt were going to be important to making
agents work, which is understanding large code bases, understanding the intent of developers, making
edits on the codebase really, really quickly, and we had all these pieces. The thing we didn't have
is a model that was capable of calling these tools efficiently enough. And then obviously in the
middle of last year that completely changed with the advent of like GPT-4, right, and with that we
basically said okay, we now have these agent capabilities, but the ceiling of what we can show to
our developers on VS Code was limited. We were not able to provide a good enough experience, and we
thought what was going to happen is developers would spend way more time not writing software but
reviewing software that the AI was going to put out.

We are I think a technology company at heart, and I, you know, I think we are a product company, but
I think the product serves the technology, which is to say we want to make the product as good as
possible to make it so that people can experience the technology, right. And we felt that we were,
you know, with VS Code we were not able to do that. So the middle of last year we decided hey, like
we need to actually go out and actually have our own IDE out there. Um, so that's what that's what
triggered actually creating Windsurf the way that you did that was you forked VS Code. For VS Code
you got a whole new set of capabilities that you guys had to learn, like basically how to like
develop on this VS Code base that I'm sure is super complicated.

Host: Yeah, we needed to figure that out. Uh that was one once again another thing where uh we ended
up shipping Windsurf out in uh within uh less than three months of starting the project. Uh that's
when we we shipped it out across all operating systems.

Verun: Wow. And what what happened like, was it like take off immediately or was it unnoticed for
for a long time?

Host: It took off pretty quickly, I would say. Um, I think the speed at which it took off among
early adopters was was quite high. There were obviously some very rough edges, and this is like one
of those things where, you know, because of the rough edges obviously people started coming and
leaving the platform fairly quickly. But what we saw was like, as we improved the capabilities of
the agent, as we improved the capabilities of the passive experience, even the passive tab
experience has made massive leaps um in the last like couple months. We started realizing that not
only were people talking about the product more and more, uh people were also staying on the product
uh more and more at a higher rate.

Verun: How many people worked on shipping Windsurf? And it was done in a period of one or two
months?

Host: Uh a couple months. So yeah, like less than three months. Um, this was another. I wouldn't say
it's a bet the company moment because it's not a fundamentally different uh sort of paradigm
compared to like moving from a GPU virtualization product to a to an like a an AI code product. But
yeah, it was uh anyone that could work on it needed to kind of like drop what they were working on
in the past and work on it immediately. And at that time, how how big uh were you guys?

Verun: The engineering team was probably still less than 25 people.

Host: Wow. This is crazy. Interestingly, our company actually, from an employee standpoint, actually
didn't have that few people. We actually had a fairly large go-to-market team, because it's in the
AI space. One thing that's like a little bit weird about our company compared to most other
companies is we have a fairly large go-to-market team. Like we were selling our product to the
largest Fortune 500 companies. It's very hard to do that purely by letting them swipe a credit card.
Uh you need a lot of support. You need to make sure that the that the technology is like getting
adopted properly. Um, which is very different than just give the people the product and see it grow
um effectively. So from an engineering standpoint, we've always run fairly lean. Uh but because of
the market interest, we've always had a lot of people in go-to-market actually.

Verun: Who are like sort of the ideal people to go into that function? Is it, you know, really good
engineers who want to be forward deployed?

Host: Yeah, we so we have two components of it. We have account executives. These are folks that um
in general we we try to find people that are very curious and excited about the capabilities. In
fact, people that would use Windsurf in their free time because they're they're providing the
product to leaders who also love software and technology, right? So, if they're if they're just
completely just unaware of the technology, they're not going to be helpful. And then we also have
these deployed engineer uh like sort of roles, similar to what you said, uh that get their hands
really dirty with the technology and make sure that our customers get the most value from the from
the technology.

Verun: I mean the wild thing is uh because everyone uses Windsurf, it sounded like um you're having
even these AEs who are non-technical become like just vibe coding champions.

Host: Yeah. No, one of our biggest users of Windsurf at the company is a is a nontechnical person
who leads uh like partnerships uh at the company. Uh he has actually replaced buying a bunch of
sales tools uh inside the company. uh and uh this is one of those things where I think Windsurf is
giving power back to the domain experts, right. In the past what would happen in an organization is
he would need to talk to a product manager who would talk to an engineer, and the engineer would
have a large backlog, because there this clearly doesn't immediately make the product better, right,
so this has to be a lower priority. But now he is actually kind of uh empowered to actually go and
build these apps.

Verun: Does he have any programming background at all? Interesting, cuz that's definitely one of the
controversies on Twitter at the moment is just like, is vibe coding, can you actually vibe code
unless you know some amount of coding already?

Host: Yeah. One of the things we do have is if we do need to deploy one of these apps, we have a
person that actually focuses on making sure that these apps are secure and deployed. But the amount
of leverage that that person has is ridiculous. Instead of him going out and building all of these
apps, the non-zero could actually get built by by people that are domain experts but non-technical
inside the company.

Verun: With the Kodium launch, you went head-on against like Microsoft and GitHub, and like, you
know, these huge incumbents. With the IDE launch, you went sort of head-on against Cursor. It's like
the hot startup of the moment, and like um, I know, again, how was how did you all think about that
internally?

Host: This might be a weird thing about our company, but our company just doesn't have like, like
morale is not really affected by what other companies do, right. Uh it's not possible if uh like our
company has gone through a lot of basically very turbulent times. The fact that we needed to pivot
at ten employees and just completely kill our idea is like a normal thing for the company. And then
secondly, kind of like the companies that are relevant in our space has always been a fluctuating uh
set of companies. Like, you know, I I really respect all the companies in our space, but yeah,
Copilot, if you were to go to the beginning of 2023, everyone would have thought GitHub Copilot was
the product that everyone would use and there was no point building. And in the middle uh kind of
Devin came out, and like everyone was like hey, like Devin is going to solve everything, right? Um,
and and I'm sure they're doing good work now. Uh, but and then after that, obviously, Cursor is is
doing a really great job. So, I think what really matters to us most is are we actually, do we have
a good long-term strategy, and are we executing in a way where we're getting towards that long-term
strategy while being flexible with the details, right? And as long as we're doing that, I think we
we have a fighter's chance, right? And that's like the way we've always.

Verun: Do you educate yourself at all on the competitor's products, though?

Host: Yeah. Yeah. I think we don't want to put our heads in the sand and kind of tell ourselves our
product is awesome. Um and uh and and just kind of because it's very easy to do that, um especially
given the fact that before we worked on Windsurf, the company was also growing very, very quickly
from like a revenue standpoint.

Verun: What sort of opinions did you have, or what taste or opinions did you have for the full IDE
um that was sort of maybe different to Cursor? I'm actually asking, is Cursor is a very well-liked
product, obviously, and so at a product level, why are you like, oh yeah, like actually we want to
build it this way.

Host: Yeah. No, I think it's a great question. Uh so maybe the first point is at the time actually
when we started working on Windsurf, all the products were basically chat and this autocomplete uh
capability. I think that's basically what uh GitHub Copilot was, what Cursor was at the time. I
think we took a very opinionated stance that we thought agents were were uh where the technology was
actually going. We were the first agentic editor that was out there. Um and uh I think the biggest
sort of takeaway was we didn't believe in this kind of paradigm where everyone would be at
mentioning everything, right? This almost reminded us of like the anti-pattern of what Google and
and these search engines were before like Google improved their product a lot, which was kind of
like these landing pages that had like every distinct kind of like bucket of things you could search
for. But Google came out with this very clean search box. Even Google at the time, you would need
you would get better answers if you wrote and or uh like site link. Um and now it's gotten way
better, right.

And I guess we had a belief that the the software would get more and more easy to build, right, and
we would build from that starting point. When we saw all the other players in the space making their
product so configurable in a way that we thought was I think good for users now for what the
technology was, but something that wouldn't be unnecessary down the line. So we invested in
capabilities like, how do you deeply understand the codebase to understand the intent of the
developer? How do you how do you actually go out and uh and and make changes in a way that's like
very quick um to the codebase. We took the approach of, hey, instead of having this readonly system
where you tag everything, what happens if you could make changes very quickly, and that's why like
at the time we we were kind of the first to do that. Now if you were to ask like, is that a very
obvious decision now, I think it's very obvious now it looks very obvious. And this is where like
one of the things that I think is is true for any startup is you have to keep proving yourself,
right, like every single insight that we have is a depreciating insight. It is a very, very
depreciating insight like technology. The reason why companies win um at any given point is not like
they had a tech insight like one year ago, right? Actually, if a company wins, um, other than the
fact that they have, you know, a monopoly, uh you know, it's it's a it's actually like a compounding
tech advantage that keeps sort of existing over and over again. And I think the example of this that
I find most most exciting is you look at a company like Nvidia. If Nvidia doesn't innovate in the
next two years, AMD will be on their case, right. And Nvidia will not be able to make 60, 70% gross
margins at that point, right, um, even though it's like one of the largest companies in existence uh
right now. By basically having good insights to start with, you're able to learn from the market and
maybe compound that advantage with time, and that's the only thing that that is uh that could be
persistent.

Verun: It sounds like a moat is uh you know, we think of it as a noun, but it's actually a verb.

Host: Yeah. Something that could change with time, right. I also think for us and I tell the company
this, if we're not continuing to have insights, and that's why I'm completely okay with a lot of our
insights being wrong. Um, if we don't continually have insights that we are executing on, we are
just slowly dying. Um, that's like what's actually happening.

Verun: I think the interesting thing is that is easier now looking back and connecting the dots on
your journey, how a lot of these technology bets you took actually did end up compounding what
Windsurf ended up becoming, right. Like it was happenstance that you being really good at GPU
deployment, VMware optimization, ended up being the thing to be really good at, you know, being
blazingly fast autocomplete because it's faster than other products, right. So that kind of
compounded there. There's the aspect of you building all these uh plugins for enterprises and being
so good at reading large code bases, and you did something that was contrarian. There was a lot of
products and we work with OC companies. A lot of uh codegen tools use uh vector databases, because
we work with a lot of companies, and that's was the standard approach, how a lot of folks were
building. But you guys did something very different, right?

Host: Yeah. So, one of the things that sort of uh I think got really popular is this term RAG got
very popular. You weren't anti-RAG.

Verun: Yeah. I don't know if we're anti-anti-RAG.

Host: RAG obviously makes sense. You do want to retrieve some stuff, and based on the retrieval, you
want to generate some stuff. So, I guess the idea is is correct that you know, everything is
retrieval-augmented generation. But I think what people got maybe a little too opinionated about was
like the way RAG is implemented. It has to be a vector database that you go out and search. I think
a vector database is a tool in the toolkit, right? If you were to think about what users ultimately
want, they want great answers, and they want uh great agents. That's what they actually want. And
how do you end up doing

Host: That? You need to make sure that what's in the context is as relevant as possible. So what we
ended up doing is having a series of systems that enable us to pack the context with the most
relevant snippets of code. And the way we ultimately did that was it was a combination of keyword
search, RAG, abstract syntax tree parsing and then on top of that using as you mentioned all the GPU
infrastructure we have to take large chunks of the codebase and in real time rank it right as the
query is coming in right and we found that that is like the best way for us to find the best context
for the user. And the kind of the motivation for this is because people have kind of weird
questions. They might have a question for a large codebase of upgrade all versions of this API to
this API. And if embedding search only finds five of them, it's not of the ten, it's not a very
useful feature at that point. So we needed to make sure the precision recall was as high as
possible, which meant that we used a series of technologies to actually get to the best solution.

Interviewer: There's a bit of a thing going on with a lot of AI startups getting built taking too
much of an intellectual shortcut with what works for the problem domain space but you took it from
first principles right so you build like a way more complex system that did a parsing of all this
stuff which is like cool.

Host: Yeah I think maybe one of the things that I think is potentially interesting to discuss there
is we started off a lot of the companies started off working on autonomous vehicles and the reason
why that's kind of important is these are systems where you can't just YOLO these systems, which is
to say you build the software and then you kind of let it run. You need really good evaluation. I
think at the company we don't strive for complexity. We strive for what works. And then the question
then is like why is the system so much more complex now? It was because we built really good
evaluation systems.

Interviewer: Oh interesting. How do the evals work?

Host: Yeah, so the evals for code are actually really cool. Basically the idea is code you can
leverage a property of code which is it can be run, right? And we not only have real-time user data,
we can put that aside for now, but we can take a lot of open source projects and find I guess
commits in these open source projects with tests attached to them. So you can imagine a lot of cool
things we can do based on that. You can take the intent of a commit, delete all the code that is not
the unit test, right? And then you can see, hey, are you able to retrieve the parts where the change
needs to get made? Do you have a good high-level intent to make those changes? And then after making
the changes, does the test pass? You can do that task, you can mask the task. And by masking the
task, it's more like the Google task. And what I mean by the Google task is it's trying to predict
your intent, which is to say, let's say you only put in a third of the change, but you don't get the
intent. Can you then fill out the rest to make the test pass? So there's so many ways you can slice
this. And each of them, you can break it down into so much granularity. You can be like, what is my
retrieval accuracy? What is my intent accuracy? What is my test passing accuracy? You can do that.
And then now you have a hill to climb. And I think that's actually important before you add a lot of
complexity for any of these AI apps. I think you need to make a rigorous hill that you can actually
climb, right? Otherwise, you're just shooting in the dark, right? Why would we add the AST parsing
if it's unnecessary? Actually, it's awesome if it was unnecessary. Right? I don't want to add a lot
of complex stuff to our code. In fact, I want the simplest code that ends up doing the most impact.
So the eval is really critical for us to make a lot of these investments at the company.

Interviewer: How much of the development that you do is like basically driven by improving the
scores on the eval versus like basically vibes-based? Like you guys are all using Windsurf yourself
you're getting feedback from users all the time and then you have just like a sense that this thing
is going to work better and then the evals are just sort of like a check that you didn't screw up
something else?

Host: It's a little bit of both but obviously for some kinds of systems I think evals are more
important than vibes but like more so than vibes just because for the system that basically takes a
large chunk of the code chunks it up and passes it to hundreds of GPUs in parallel giving you a
result in one it's very hard to have an intuition of like is this way better because that's a very
complex sort of retrieval question. Um but on the other hand there are much easier things that from
a vibe perspective are valuable. What if we looked at the open files in a codebase? This is actually
harder thing to eval because when you're evaling you don't know what the user is doing in real time.
This is one of those cases where having a product and market helps us a lot right and we're able to
take a lot of user data on how people use the product to actually actively make the product much
better. So that maybe starts with vibes and then after that you can build eval right so it's a
little bit of both basically.

Interviewer: I think a lot of there's been a lot of chatter on the internet about vibes code is only
for toy apps Windsurf is actually being used for real production large code bases can you tell us
about how the power users use it for like more hardcore engineering?

Host: So this is an interesting thing where a lot of us at the company I'm not saying that this is
common didn't get a tremendous value from ChatGPT in the way that probably a lot of the rest of the
world did. Um and that's not because ChatGPT is not a useful product. I think ChatGPT is an
incredibly useful product. It's actually because a lot of them had already used things like Stack
Overflow at the time. And Stack Overflow is a worse version than ChatGPT for the kinds of questions
you want, but that was just a thing that they already knew how to use, right? Um and so they were
able to get away with not using or relying on chat nearly as much. But basically what happened is
very recently with agents, the agent is making larger and larger scale changes with time. And I
think what developers now at our company do is they have felt the hills and valleys of this product
which is to say if you don't provide enough intent it actually goes out and changes way more of the
code than you actually need. Right? Um and this is like a real problem with the tool right now. But
they understand the hills and valleys and now the very first time they have a task they are putting
it into Windsurf. They're not their first thing is not to actually go out and type in the actual
editor. It's to actually put the intent and actually make those changes. Um and they're doing kind
of very interesting things now like deploying our software to our servers actually now gets done
with the workflows that are entirely built inside Windsurf. Uh so just a lot of boilerplate and
repetitive tasks have been completely eliminated inside our company. But the reason why this is
possible is kind of because we're able to operate over a codebase that has many millions of lines of
code really effectively.

Interviewer: So if you were to give some tips to the audience, how should a user that uses Windsurf
properly provide this intent so that the changes are more surgical? Because what you're saying with
the agents creating all these broad changes, I've seen that happen. But how do you get those precise
changes? What do you do? How do you feed the system? How do you become a, SHOUTED IN ALL CAPS,
right?

Host: Yeah. Um, no. So I think this is one of those things where I think you kind of need to have a
little bit of faith in the system and let it kind of mess up a little bit. Uh which is which is kind
of scary because I think a lot of people for the most part they will write off these tools really
quickly. Obviously, no one at our company would write off the tool because they're building the
tools themselves. I think people's expectations are very high and maybe that's like the main piece
of feedback I'd give which is that you know our product actually for these larger and larger changes
it might make 90% of the changes correctly but if 10% is wrong people will just write off the entire
tool and I think at that point actually probably the right thing to do is either revert the change
we have an ability to actually revert the change or just keep going and see where it ultimately can
go. And maybe the most important aspect is commit your code like as frequently as possible. I think
that maybe that's like the big tip there which is that you know you don't want to get in a situation
where you've made 20 changes and on top of that made some changes yourselves and you can't like
revert it and then you get like very frustrated at the end of it.

Interviewer: And one thing I've wondered like in that vein is whether we need to change the way git
works with this AI coding paradigm have you thought at all about whether doing git commit all the
time is the right move or whether there needs to be like a deeper infrastructure change?

Host: Yeah I think we have. So one of the things that we always think of is in the future you're
going to have many many agents running in parallel on your codebase. That has some trade-offs,
right? If you have two agents that kind of modify the same piece of code at the same time, it's hard
to actually know what's going on. That's another thing is that like it's hard to have multiple
branches checked out at the same time with different agents working on them independently. All the
merge conflicts. Oh god. Yeah, there's a lot of. But hey, like you know, that's how that's how real
software development works too. When you have a lot of engineers that operate on a codebase, they're
all like kind of mucking around with the codebase at the same time. So that's not a very unique
thing. I think git is a great tool. I think it's maybe a question of like how can you skin git to
work in a way that works for this product surface. An example is git has these things called work
trees which is like you can have many work trees and versions of the repository all in your all in
the same directory. Um and you know perhaps you can have many of these agents working on different
work trees. Or instead of exposing the branch concept to you, you actually can maintain a branch
yourself that you can apply to the main branch of the user um kind of repeatedly. One of the things
that we think about at the company in terms of why we think our agent is really good is like we try
to have a unified timeline on everything that happened. The unified timeline is not just what the
developer did but actually what the developer did in addition to what the agent did. So actually our
product if you end up doing things in the editor if you end up doing things in the terminal right
all of those things are captured and the intent is actually kind of tracked in such a way where when
you use the AI the AI knows right in that situation. So in some ways, we'd like this thing where the
agent is not operating on a completely different timeline, but it's like something that's kind of
getting merged in you know, at a fairly high cadence. Um so I think this is like an open problem. I
don't think we have like the exact right answer for this.

Interviewer: What are other things that you envision changing about Windsurf in the future? How is
it going to evolve?

Host: There's probably a lot of people that think the vibe coding is kind of a fad, but I think
that's going to get more and more capable with time. I think you know, whenever I hear someone
saying, "Hey, this is not going to work for this complex use case," it feels like a lite saying
something, right? It's like if you look at the way these AIs have gotten better sort of year over
year, it's actually astonishing. Like I'll give you an example of something that I held kind of near
and dear to my heart which is you know there's this math Olympiad called AMC and I used to do that
in high school. Um and you know I was very excited about how well I would do. My high score was
somewhere close to 14. And that's a very high score. Yeah. But the crazy thing is that was one of
those things that I thought oh wow like the AI systems they're not going to get anywhere near. And
beginning of the year last year it was probably like well under five maybe. Um and now they're you
know the average that OpenAI is like it's getting 14 and a half to 15 right for O4 mini. So it's
almost like you have to keep projecting this out right? It's going to get crazy. And basically every
part of the software development life cycle whether it be writing code reviewing code testing code
debugging code designing code AI is going to be adding ten times the amount of leverage very
shortly. It's going to happen like much much more quickly than people imagine.

Interviewer: Going back to your current engineering team, I'm curious like if they have all this
time freed up from you know not having to deal with like version upgrades and you know boring boiler
plate stuff like what do they spend the extra time on?

Host: One of the things about our company and probably every startup that is building in the space
is the ceiling of where the technology can go is so high. It's so high. So it's actually that you
know if developers can spend less time doing boiler plate they can spend more time testing
hypothesis for things that they're not sure work right. In some ways engineering becomes a lot more
of like a research kind of culture right where you're testing hypothesis really quickly. Um and that
has some high cycle time attached to it right. You need to go out and implement things you need to
build the evaluation you need to test it out with our users but that's like the things that actually
make the product way better.

Interviewer: Does that mean you're going to hire a different type of engineer going forward? Like
you're looking for different things?

Host: Yeah, I think for engineers that we hire, we want to look for people with really high agency
that are willing to be wrong and bold. But you know, weirdly, I don't know if that's changed for a
startup, right? Startup should never be hiring people that the reason why they're joining a company
is to very quickly write like boilerplate code, right? Because in some sense, and I don't want like
you know, this is not the goal, but a startup can succeed even if they have extremely kind of ugly
code, right? That's not usually the reason why a startup fails.

Interviewer: Sounds like my startup.

Host: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. That's not usually the reason why startup fails. The reason why a startup
fails is they didn't build a product that was differentially good for their users. That's why they
ultimately failed. This is all true, but also like in reality, you always need some

Host: Sort of like work horses to just kind of get certain things done. I feel like in the old days
this was like building Android apps. Um, it's like you hired someone to do it because there were
very few people who would just be willing to do it.

Windsurf CEO: Yeah.

Host: Like maybe in your vision for engineering, like you don't need those? Like that's not actually
a useful skill to have in an organization anymore because the AI is just like your infinite
workhorse. Is that fair?

Windsurf CEO: Yeah. Maybe the sort of aspects of software that are really niche that are undesirable
for a lot of people to do except a handful of people. Those things kind of get democratized a lot
more unless that has like a lot of depth attached to it, right? At least for the time being. Um,
yeah, if something is like, hey, like, you know, we need to change a system to use a new version.
Um, and there was someone that deeply always got in the weeds with version changes. I don't think
you have people that are just focused on that, right, inside companies.

Host: How about how you interview people?

Windsurf CEO: Yeah, I think we have a fairly rigorous and high technical bar and that has a that's a
combination of we give interviews that actually allow people to use the AI to kind of solve a
problem because we want to validate if people like kind of hate these tools or not. There are still
some developers that do and obviously if you do we're probably the wrong company to kind of work at.
But also at the same time we do have sort of interviews in person where, uh, kind of on site where
we don't give them the AI and we want to see them think, right? It would be a bad thing if
ultimately when someone needs to write a nested for loop they need to go to ChatGPT, right? And I'm
not like that's fundamentally because because, uh, it just it just feels like that is a good proxy
for problem solving skills and I think problem solving skills are just at a high level still should
go at a premium. That is the valuable skill that humans have.

Host: Yeah. A challenge that a lot of companies we've talked to have had that that we've even had
ourselves is that Windsurf has gotten so good that if you give people Windsurf it's difficult to
even come up with an interview question that Windsurf can't just oneshot where, you know, anyone can
do it because you literally just copy and paste the question into Windsurf and hit enter and so
you're not really evaluating anything at that point.

Windsurf CEO: So I actually think that's true and it's, it's you're totally right. There's very few
problems now that something like an O4 Mini is not able to solve now. Um, right? I mean, if you look
at competitive programming, it's just it's just in a league of its own already at this point. The
crazy thing is interviews by nature are going to be kind of isolated problems, right? They're by
nature because if the problem actually required so much understanding to do, you wouldn't be able to
explain the problem. So, that's like perfect for the LLM where you give them an isolated problem
where you can test and run code extremely quickly. So, yeah, you're totally right. Like I think if
you tell if you only have algorithmic interviews and you let people use the AI, I don't know, you're
not really testing anything at that point.

Host: Does that mean that you've gone away from just algorithmic questions and you ask different
like much harder questions that are actually well suited to being able to use an AI?

Windsurf CEO: Yeah, we we have questions obviously where that are that are both system design-y plus
algorithms related. But these are questions that are fairly open-ended, right? Uh, there may not be
a correct answer. There are there are trade-offs that you can ultimately make and I think what we
want to do is just see how people think, right? Given different trade-offs and different
constraints, right? Uh, and and we're trying to validate for like intellectual curiosity, right? And
if someone ultimately says I don't know, why, why, why, that's totally fine as long as like they've
gone to a depth that we feel, um, kind of shows you kind of interest, um, interest and like good
problem solving skills if that makes sense. Like you can tell when someone is curious, right? And
wants to learn things. It's like very obvious. The next thought after is which might be
counterintuitive.

Host: You're at the forefront of building all these AI coding tools. It hasn't affected at all your
hiring plans. On the contrary, you actually need way more engineers to execute. Tell us more about
that.

Windsurf CEO: So, I think I think that just boils down to I think the problem has a very high
ceiling, right? There's so many more things that we really want to do. The mission of the company is
to reduce the time it takes to build technology and apps by 99%. It's going to take a lot of work to
go out and do that. Now granted, each person in our company is way more productive than they were a
year ago. Uh, but I think for us to go out and accomplish that, I think it's, you know, it's a
Herculean task. We need to start targeting more of the development experience. Right? Right now,
we've helped a lot with the code writing process. Um, and and maybe the the the navigation of code
process, but we have not touched much on the on the design process, on the deploying process, the
debugging process is fairly rudimentary right now. There's just so many different pieces. Is if I
was to look at it like, you know, if you say you have 100 units of time, you know, we have an axe,
we've cut off maybe like 40 or 50 in that in that in that time, but there's just a lot more snippets
that we need to cut out basically at this point.

Host: It does feel like when I'm using Windsurf like I am often the extremely slow bridge between
different pieces of technology copying and pasting data back and forth from my that's probably
actually still a large chunk of your time all the pieces have gotten so fast that now it's like the
glue between them but like I'm the glue but I'm like much slower. Can I go off the reservation and
ask a weird question.

Windsurf CEO: Go for it.

Host: Okay. Uh, one of the things that I mean, I think Pete on our team, he just released a great
essay about, you know, prompting and you should let users have access to system prompts. The other
thing that he came up with that we've been using all at YC internally is a new agent infrastructure
that has direct access, read access to our system of record, our Postgres database. And in the
process of using this, we're starting to realize like if codegen gets a lot better, which it's, you
know, I based on this conversation, I think we can count on that getting like 10x, 100x better from
here. Uh, what if instead of you know building package software, there's like just in time software
that the agent basically just builds for you as you need it. Does that change the nature of software
and SaaS? And you know what happens to all of us in Windsurf? I don't know.

Windsurf CEO: I think this notion of just a developer is is probably going to broaden out to what's
called a builder and uh I think everyone is going to be a builder and they can decide like you know
how deep they want to go and build things. Uh, maybe maybe our current version of developers can go
deep enough that they can build more complex things, right? Um, in the in the shorter term, but
yeah, I think software is going to be this very very democratized thing, right? I I imagine a future
in which you know what actually happens when you ask an AI assistant, hey, build me something that
like tracks the amount of calories I have. Why would you have a very custom app that goes out and
does this? It's probably something that takes like all the inputs from your AR glasses and
everything and has a custom piece of software that kind of comes out and like an app that is there
and like it has tasks that go and tell you uh you know are you on track with with all the calories
you're you're sort of consuming here. Um, and I think that's a very very custom piece of software
that you have for yourself that you can keep tweaking. I can imagine a future like that where
effectively everyone is building but people don't know what they're building as software. They just
they're kind of just building uh just capabilities and technology that they have for themselves.

Host: Do many people use Windsurf who don't know how to write code at all?

Windsurf CEO: It's actually a large, a large number of our users.

Host: Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. How did they end up getting into Windsurf? Like did they work at some
company where like some programmer showed them how to use it? Like I I I tend to think of Windsurf
as targeting more like the professional developer market that's like using this as a new superpower
versus the like non-technical user market that's doing like what Gary was talking about.

Windsurf CEO: We were shocked by this too because we were like, "Hey, our product is an IDE," but
there's actually a non-trivial chunk of our developers that have never opened the editor up and they
just, you know, our agent is called Cascade, right? And uh just live in Cascade. We have browser
preview, so they just open up the browser preview. They can click on things and and sort of uh make
changes. The benefit is because because we kind of understand the code when they come back to the
repository and the code has actually gotten like quite gnarly, we're actually able to pick up from
where the developer left off or the the the the kind of builder left off and and keep going from
where they were. Um, I will say we have not optimized tremendously for that use case. But it's
actually kind of crazy how how how much is actually happening there.

Host: Do you think in the long term that this ends up being one product that targets like both of
these audiences or do you think actually there's like different products for different audiences?
Like there's like a Windsurf which is like focused on like serious developers who want to see the
code and be in the details and then there's maybe other products for for folks who are totally
nontechnical who don't who don't even want to see the code.

Windsurf CEO: I don't know what the long term is going to look like. Something tells me it's going
to become more unified. But one of the things that I will just say is like as a startup for us even
though we do have you know like a a good number of people there's a limit to what we can focus on
internally as well. Uh, so for us like we're not going to be focused on how do we build the best
possible experience for uh the developer as well as build the experience where we have so many
things for the the non-developer. But I I have to imagine that this idea of building technology if
you as you get better and better at understanding code um you're going to be able to deliver a great
experience for non-developers um as well. But I don't know what the path dependence is. I assume
like a bunch of companies in the space will go from non-developers to then supporting an ability to
edit the code, right? And I think we're starting to see this already where you know the the lines
are sort of getting blurred right now.

Host: You probably care about it for your evals at least.

Windsurf CEO: Yeah. No, you need to you need to care about it for your evals. That maybe that's like
the hard part for me that to to imagine for the pure non-developer product. What is the hill you're
climbing if you're not like kind of understanding the code? How do you know your product is getting
better and better? Um, is like an open question. Are you completely relying on the base models
getting better, which is fine, but then you should imagine then your product is an extremely light
layer on top of the base model, which is a scary place to be, right? That means you're going to get
competed across all different axis.

Host: How do you think about that in general? I guess like the something we've talked about a lot on
this podcast is just the GPT wrapper meme um has completely gone away. I feel um though every big
release from one of the labs sort of brings it back a little bit and everyone's a little bit scared
that like you know OpenAI is just going to eat everything. Um, how do you think about that?

Windsurf CEO: I think the way we I I think about this is like yeah the company as I mentioned before
it's a moving goalpost which is to say today if we're generating sort of 80, 90% of all committed
software uh yeah I think I think when the new model comes out uh we're going to need to up our game.
We can't just be at the same same stage. Maybe we need to be generating 95% of all committed code
and I think our opportunity is the gap between where the foundation model is and what the what what
100% is right and as long as we can continue to deliver an experience where there is a gap between
the two which I think there is as long as there's any human in the loop at all um in the experience
uh there's a gap we'll be able to go out and build things but that is a constantly transforming sort
of uh goalpost for us right so you can imagine when a new model comes out maybe the baseline on what
the foundation model by itself provides has doubled the alpha we provide on top of what the base
model provides needs to double as well.

Host: It feels very like for me the reason why this is not the most concerning is let's suppose that
you were to take the foundation model and it's providing 90%. It's reducing the time it takes by
90%. That actually means if we can deliver one or two percentage points, that's a 20% gain on top of
what the new baseline is, right? Like I guess 90 if 90 becomes 92 or 93. Um, which which which is
still very very valuable, right? At that point because effectively the 90 becomes the new baseline
uh for everyone. So I I think basically the way we sort of operate is how can we provide as much
additional value as possible and as long as we have our eye on that I think we're going to we're
going to do fine.

Windsurf CEO: What advice would you have for our startups that are working in the like AI coding
space? You have a ton of them. What are what are the opportunities that like you think are going to
be open to new startups? I've seen a lot of things that I I think could be like particularly
interesting. I I don't think any of these technologies we've really adopted, but there's so many
different pieces of how people build software and uh so and I'm not going to say niche, but there
are so many different types of workloads out there. I've not really seen a lot of startups in the
space that are just like we do this one thing really really well. Um, like I'll give you an example.
Like we do these kind of like Java migrations really really well. Crazy enough, if you look at this
category, the amount that people spend on this is probably maybe billions if not tens of billions of
dollars doing these migrations every year. It's a it's a massive category. Um, that's an example.

Host: Migrations from what to what?

Windsurf CEO: So example, this is like actually kind of crazy. JVM 7 to 8 or something, JVM Rails
versions even even more than that actually. It's like a lot of a lot of companies write COBOL. Have
COBOL and crazy enough most of the IRS software is written in COBOL. Apparently in the early 2000s
they try to migrate from COBOL to Java. I think it was a five plus billion dollar project. Uh,
surprise surprise it didn't happen.

Host: You think they could oneshot it now?

Windsurf CEO: I don't I don't know if they can oneshot it but I'm just kidding. But uh but no but
it's imagine imagine if you could do those tasks very well. It's such an economically valuable sort
of task. I think we obviously don't have the ability to focus on these kinds of things inside the
company. That's a very exciting space if you could do a really good job there. The second key piece
is there are so many things that developers do that are also not making the product better uh but
important like automatic resolution

Windsurf CEO: Of like, you know, kind of alerts and bugs in the software. Um, that's also a huge,
huge amount of spend out there, and I'd be curious to see like what a best-in-class product in that
category actually looks like. I'm sure someone, if they got truly in the weeds on that, they could
build an awesome product. Um, but I think I've not heard of one that is like tremendously taken off.

Host: I think those are actually both really great insights. And one thing I like about them is that
there's like it's not just an opportunity for like two startups. Like each one of those is like a
bucket that could have like a hundred large companies in. We actually do have a company from S21
called Bloop that does these Cobol to Java migrations with agents.

Windsurf CEO: That's awesome. It's a gnarly problem.

Host: It's a very gnarly problem, but if you were to talk to any company that has existed for over
thirty years, this is probably something that is costing them hundreds of millions a year. So,
reflecting on this journey, I mean, we're all really thankful for you creating Windsurf. It's
supercharging all of society right now. What would you say to the person, you know, basically the
you from five years ago before you started this whole thing?

Windsurf CEO: The biggest thing I would say is change your mind much, much faster than you believe
is reasonable. Right? It's very easy to kind of fall in love with your ideas over and over again,
and you do need to—otherwise you won't really do anything—but pivot as quickly as possible and treat
pivots as a badge of honor. Most people don't have the courage to change their mind on things, and
