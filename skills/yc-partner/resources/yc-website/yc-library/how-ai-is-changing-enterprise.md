## Transcript

Gary Tan: Wait a second. If we could use AI to automate more, we can build more. If we could build
more, we can lower the cost of things. If we can lower the cost of things, then we can actually lift
up anybody's lifestyle. Right now, I think that we're in the middle of the revolution, and the
revolution does not have to be Black Mirror. It could be something that is driven by Jevons'
Paradox, driven by abundance for everyone, and that's certainly the timeline we want to be on. So
that's the future I'm betting on.

Gary Tan: Welcome back to another episode of the Light Cone. I'm Gary. This is Jared Harge and
Diana. We're partners at YC, and collectively we funded companies worth hundreds of billions of
dollars. And today we have a really awesome guest: Aon Levy, then of Box. Love that intro.

Aon Levy: Yeah.

Gary Tan: Aon, you're one of the best product CEOs out there, public company as well. What I write
in my Wikipedia?

Aon Levy: Yeah, yeah.

Gary Tan: That's how I classify you. We're in the middle of the AI revolution. So how are you
feeling?

Aon Levy: Oh, pretty good. It's a good time to be in software right now. Yeah, feeling pretty good
today. Something we've been speaking about for a while, which I think we probably agree on, is that
the ChatGPT wrapper was like a bad meme. And that actually there's like lots of value, and always
has been, in building apps on top of these foundation model companies. In fact, the opposite might
be true.

Gary Tan: Yeah, which is going to be more value?

Aon Levy: Yeah, I think so. So it's interesting. So there's probably two percent truth in the meme
and then ninety percent not truth. And so, you know, PG, with the sort of wedge theory, is like
actually you do want something that is a simple product that finds a little wedge and then you
expand from there. You know, in the early days of cloud, if you were to be building software that
let you manage documents and data, you would have been like, well, that's a wrapper on Amazon. And
it was a total misunderstanding of the entire scale software you have to build to make the storage
bucket be useful in a particular application. So on the wrapper conversation, the exact same thing
is true, which is how much software do you need around the workflow and the proprietary business
logic and the data that the customer brings? That's actually the value, not just like what is the
set of tokens that are coming out.

Jared Harge: Where it's a little bit true, why startups should be, you know, at least think a couple
steps ahead is you probably don't want to be something that just ChatGPT would incorporate.

Aon Levy: So it's less that the model will incorporate your value proposition. It's more if there
is, you know, if the model provider also has a consumer scale application, like you don't want to be
right in the way of something that ChatGPT will just fold in directly into its functionality. So in
that case, I think you have to be, you know, sensitive to being kind of, you know, a quote-unquote
wrapper.

Diana Hu: How do you separate out stuff that's going to get incorporated into the model from stuff
that won't? Because I feel like the hard part with that often is we don't know what the next models
are going to be capable of. And there's this general sense of like, oh, well, like anything could
the AI input into the next model if it's powerful and approaches some version of generalized
intelligence.

Aon Levy: Yeah, I mean, I look at all this through the B2B lens, which I know that then probably you
just lost half the podcast listeners.

Gary Tan: B2B, actually, on the B2B front, to me it's a simpler question.

Aon Levy: Because an enterprise doesn't want a model. It wants an outcome. It wants an outcome of
customer support, you know, conversations being answered, or, you know, healthcare transcription
going into an EHR system, or an automated workflow of reading documents and contracts and plugging
that into a contract workflow. So the model getting more intelligence is actually usually a better
thing for anybody building software in those use cases because then you're doing less in terms of
hacking your way into the model because it's sort of insufficient at solving that particular
problem. But what the customer actually wants to buy is like, I need software that will plug into my
ERP system, that will plug into my support system, that will power the workflow that lets the
customer do a password reset. Like that's actually what the customer wants to buy. And what the
model is doing is sort of, you know, really abstracted from the ultimate customer value proposition.
So I think as long as you're building software that really can deliver that full outcome to the
customer, and you know, two years ago the initial wave of these use cases started to emerge, and I
think the companies that will do best are ones that realize that you need to abstract the model away
as much as possible from the ultimate value proposition. And then you just incorporate all the model
updates as quickly as possible for your customer. And again, they just buy the outcome of customer
support, but it's just getting better and better every time there's a model improvement.

Gary Tan: So I wonder, maybe one good analogy is when you were building Box, for your customers,
they didn't care what was the underlying database or cloud or what was the networking gear or all
the hard drives that were running it. It was all about the end user experience at the software
level.

Aon Levy: Yeah, and the analogy to today is the end users of B2B AI workflows don't care whatever
model is or how it does it.

Jared Harge: Yeah, but that it ultimately does the workflow.

Aon Levy: Yes, yeah. I think that that is absolutely the conclusion. You'll often get some
idiosyncrasies in different organizations where they do care, okay? Where you know, where's your
data center hosted? Or, you know, what's your infrastructure provider? But that's a small minority.
In AI, I think we're going to go through a temporary period where you do see differences in the
models for anybody that has a discerning set of skills on this front. So you know, you can see this
in like Cursor, you know, with Anthropic, right? Like people like that combination and they can
sense the differences of the output. But if you fast forward five years, I think you'll see a
convergence of basically models and intelligence to the point where you wouldn't really distinguish
the quality levels that much for ninety percent of business use cases.

Diana Hu: It's definitely interesting to see how, especially developers, have developed different
preferences for different models. Like, I remember at our AI retreat a few weeks ago, Anthropic and
Claude has also emerged as like the preferred LLM to like orchestrate your agents. Like, if you have
multiple agents and you want sort of the LLM to intelligently call the right ones, people seem to
prefer Claude for that. What do you think is going to happen to the model companies themselves in
this world though?

Aon Levy: Probably everybody needs to update their understanding of what a model company is just in
general. I actually think there's very few model companies. There are sort of AI companies that have
model, you know, frontier model labs. But increasingly, they're selling software to either consumers
or businesses. Like, I don't even know who I would consider to be a pure play model company at this
point. You know, Anthropic, if you look at their software revenue, you know, it's effectively an API
business for enterprises. I'm sure they have some large scale consumer Claude business, but you're
really paying for the security, the compliance, the governance, the privacy, the uptime, the SLAs,
talking to somebody that manages your account. And the model just continues to sort of switch out
underneath all that. If you look at OpenAI revenue, anything that's been kind of leaked publicly,
it's very clearly a software company at this point that has AI models that power its underlying
software. Google obviously is just GCP. And then Meta doesn't need to monetize it because they can
just open source it. So maybe xAI is almost the closest thing to now a model company. But that will
show up in Grok, et cetera. So you know, what you probably wouldn't want to do right now is start a
pure play model company expecting you're going to have licensing revenue by just selling your model
to people to go and use. If you don't have enough other kind of surrounding value proposition that
lets you get incorporated into enterprises or has a large scale consumer application where you have
some degree of traffic that keeps people within your ecosystem, I think it'd be very bad to be just
a pure play model company at this moment, just because you have enough different business models
that have emerged now in AI. Where it's going to be pretty hard if your pure play business model is
just pure AI tokens because you always have Meta that will always create a counterbalance by just
open sourcing a frontier model that kind of wipes you out. Now DeepSeek. And now DeepSeek.

Jared Harge: And that's what's amazing is like now that you can basically guarantee Meta has to do
anything DeepSeek does because it obviously has to stay in the game on the open source front. And so
we always have enough dynamism in this industry that basically ensures to Gary's opening point that
like the cost of intelligence is going to go to zero. Like it's just absolutely guaranteed.

Gary Tan: So extrapolating, what does it mean for startups as intelligence becomes commodity
basically?

Aon Levy: Well, the good news is we kind of know the playbook on this, with one X factor, which is
like AGI and like what is the ultimate, you know, kind of exactly a little bit of an X factor of
like wiping out all of all relevant business models that we don't even have money in the future. But
like, if you put that to the side, I think these companies need to look like software companies. And
it is sort of back to basics, which is, you know, we used to have an API into a database. We had an
API into storage. We had an API into compute. Now we have an API into intelligence. That
intelligence, it should be, you know, basically the cost of that intelligence will go down to the
cost of the bare metal. So whatever the underlying cost of the GPU is, that's what you're going to
pay, you know, with a little bit of margin from a hyperscaler. But the cost of the AI tokens, you
know, will converge at zero. And so then it's all about, you know, do you build software that takes
this complicated technology and delivers it to customers to solve real world problems? And so, you
know, you guys have talked a lot about vertical AI. I think that's a massive play. I think there's
going to be a whole layer of AI software that stitches together different AI systems. So you have
horizontal plays. You have vertical plays. I think the idea of every single industry and every job
function probably will have some degree of new startups and agents that get built out for those
slots. I don't know if you guys have like a whiteboard of every industry and every job. But like,
you can just basically play Bingo on that and then until it's fully filled in, like there's probably
still opportunity left with AI. We figured out the first wave of SaaS of how to do this. You know,
YC was obviously a big part of a number of major category killers in SaaS. And I think we'll see the
same playbook happen in AI.

Diana Hu: One of the many interesting things about DeepSeek was specifically it's the first open
source reasoning model. Like, in the short term, do you think there's like new ideas in the
enterprise in particular that are going to come out because now we have open source reasoning
models?

Aon Levy: So what we've seen is we do a number of benchmarking exercises internally for the
reasoning models versus non-reasoning models. And some things that they're actually better at, some
things are weirdly worse at. And I don't think we've even discovered why they're worse at these
things. Maybe they overthink a problem. In general, I would just argue that anything that
directionally improves intelligence, you will see B2B use cases. You'll see the value of those use
cases go up because you know, you can begin to reasonably chain together more agents working
together. You can get more agentic workflows happening. Like anytime we can get the intelligence
factor to go up, I can now reliably introduce this for a more important business process. And so,
you know, in the enterprise, you can almost think about it as there's some probably, you know,
either a two-by-two or chart. I don't know if anybody's made it, but like, kind of like mission
criticality of the workflow, AI level of intelligence. And there's an element of like, you can't
introduce it to, you know, close banking, you know, banking systems, you know, end of day data, you
know, yet, because it's not particularly deterministic. We don't sort of know all the answers that
it's going to give. But it could write a summary for a new product launch at a bank, or it could
help answer banking product questions if you're a consumer. So there's a continuum there. And as we
get every degree of intelligence going up, we get more use cases that we can now implement this for.
And then there's another axis, which is like, how many of those use cases can you string together to
complete the full workflow of that business process? And that's yet another access that we're early
in. But like, you know, I was in New York a couple weeks ago meeting lots of banks. And you know,
just generally what you think of like the New York industries in enterprise. And I would say we're
like ten percent of the way into the adoption of let's say just like general chat assistants. And
like one percent of the way into adoption of anything we would all call agents. And that's maybe
even inflated numbers.

Gary Tan: When you're in the room with like the banks, the 1500s, or the people making their
decisions in enterprise, do they really have zero interest in the underlying models? Like, is
DeepSeek coming out just like a total nothing burger for them? And they just care about what you're
pitching them and offering them, or do they have interest in the actual underlying tech?

Aon Levy: There are people like us and the people listening at every company in the planet. And so
those people care. By the time you get to the line of business, so I'm the head of wealth management
at a bank, they don't care. So but the CTO cares. And the head of AI cares. And the IT folks that
dabble, and they're hanging out on Hacker News, like those people, they care because they're using
Cursor and they're seeing the differences between Anthropic and OpenAI tokens within that. But when
it goes to talking to an executive in the business or the daily end user, they have no interest.
It's all, you know, a foreign language to them. And I think that will remain the way forever. I
think more of the expectation is is...

Aon Levy: That again, these things will converge. And what's amazing about AI is, because of the—I
don't want to call these the models fungible, but directionally fungible—because they're somewhat
fungible, you will see characteristics that we've seen in other areas of compute, which is any best-
in-class model eventually has to match the price of anybody that beats them in pricing. Because you
can just switch to a slightly inferior model, even if it's like inferior by one percent. The risk is
that you could switch to that and be and find it acceptable for, you know, eighty percent of your
use cases, which then by definition means whoever is at the frontier actually still has to match the
pricing of somebody just slightly worse than them. Because they could just, you know, the US
actually doesn't care—do care—and their business could evaporate if they don't do that. Which means
ironically, you could actually stay on one of the providers. You could just pick a provider and you
kind of know that your tokens will become as cheap as the second or third, you know, cheapest
option. Because that first, you know, whatever that first provider is, the marginal next marginal
customer doesn't have to choose them. They could choose the second or third player. So you, which
eventually then, you know, you run that experiment out, you know, ten years, you converge on
basically the same pricing. Which is what we've seen, which is like the difference in pricing of,
you know, storage buckets, you know, between the top three or four hyperscalers are not so different
to drive business model, you know, fundamentally different business models, um, in the software
stack similar to compute, et cetera. So really, you're making a choice based on, you know, some
other set of reasons. Like, how much data do I have in the system? What are my workflows that I've
built in the system? Um, and, uh, and then I think the again, the price of the AI eventually becomes
largely the same.

Host: Actually, I think what you're saying applies to what we're seeing for startups. I've done a
number of office hours with AI startups that are selling to enterprises. And a particular story is
this company that scaled to twelve million revenue within a year. Yeah, they actually switch models
underneath a number of times. And the end customers, which were these big enterprises, didn't care.
Yeah, what they cared about was that ultimately the contract and expectations was that just get the
workflow done with this level of accuracy done. Yeah, and as the cost per token has been cheaper,
they actually have been increasing their margins. I think when they started launching, I think their
margins were around like thirty percent. Yeah, the next cycle of iterations, middle of last year
with all the model releases, got to sixty percent. And I think now they're at like eighty percent.
That sounds like cloud storage. Yeah, exactly. We love that. So that's kind of happening. I like a
concrete example for this company that done office hours, and exactly, I mean, your analogy is
actually quite quite literal.

Aon Levy: So we, right now publicly, we have eighty-one percent gross margin. Um, um, if you had
said, you know, let's say when we started the company in '05, that a business that was perceived to
be storing data would have eighty percent margin, you'd be like, "No, that doesn't make any sense."
Because, like, people are just paying for the storage. And it's like, "No, we have"—I mean, you
know, we have nearly a thousand engineers, but one to two percent of them are working on what we
would call file storage. So what is everybody else doing? We're building software that is the
abstraction layer of compute and storage and databases to produce workflow and data governance and
automation and insights on data. So the storage is is now, you know, a small fraction of what we
overall provide. So similar to tokens, as you know, the tokens go down, as a ratio of what you're
really delivering as value is that software stack. So I think, you know, probably one way to think
about it as a heuristic is, like, how much software is necessary on top of the output of the tokens
for your value proposition to work, you know, successfully for the customer? The less software there
is, probably the higher risk you'd have to either more competition or commoditization. The more
software there is, where the tokens are just one, you know, kind of contained component of the full
thing, then you're probably, you know, in a position where you can build a moat, you can get
stickier, you can then, you know, solve more of that customer problem. But you might get to the
point where the customer pays for a discrete outcome.

Host: This is like one of the big open questions. I'm sure you're seeing it in the batches. But
like, what is your pricing model? Do you, do you pay, you know, let's say you're a startup that does
AI lead generation. Do you pay per lead, right? That's a fairly obvious, you know, kind of thing
that you'd expect. And then basically that company now could be, you know, or do you even pay for,
like, qualified lead, that the customer sort of says is actually successful? So there's a whole
continuum of like, "I pay for the successful outcome. I pay for any outcome. Or I pay for the
underlying kind of resource utilization," which we also see in, like, coding startups, you know,
where it's like, "Okay, I want to buy some unit of compute measurement that goes into useful work."
Um, but the cool thing is we're going to see a mix of all new business models and software that we
haven't seen before.

This would have been one of the biggest changes in the advice I give to startups during the batch
is, I like, it was really hardwired into me. When a startup comes to me—like, we're getting like a
pilot or they're going to pay us as we go or something like that—to like say, "That's not a real
customer. Like, you have to go back and you have to get them to sign like an annual contract and
lock in revenue. Otherwise, you're just kind of wasting your time with someone who's sort of one
foot in, one foot out." But over the last year in particular, when I look at the most successful
companies, essentially often they're like replacing a BPO or some sort of service like that. The
customer actually wants usage-based. And the revenues just keep going up and up and up. So I'm no
longer like, "Oh, you have to sign an annual contract."

Aon Levy: Yeah, yeah. I mean, we, you know, for a lot of areas where we're sort of, you know,
there's a direct relationship between the thing that the company is selling and then, you let's say
labor on the other end, you do need, you know, a lot. You know, like, you need long-term contracts
because you have to hire people. You have, there's a lot of infrastructure you have to build out.
The great thing about AI is it's entirely elastic. Yeah, so it, it, that's—I mean, we're going to
have to, you know, imagine a new world where all of a sudden I have elastic resources for things
that otherwise used to be very operationally intensive. So one day I can just say, "Hey, I want to I
want ten thousand leads generated. Go run, you know, AI to go do that." And in the, you know, in a
traditional way of doing that, that might take months of hiring and staffing and building out teams.
Now it's, you know, a week later, you're off to the races, you're generating those leads. You know,
you can kind of go through any analogy of the business, um, and uh, and that becomes possible. So
totally different relationship between, uh, you know, the company and getting outcomes and output,
totally different relationship also than for the software provider and what their business model is
with that customer.

Host: Aaron, can we go back to your trip to New York City?

Aon Levy: Yes, just any of my, any of my trips.

Host: Well, like, you spend a lot of time talking to senior execs at Fortune 500 companies about
their technology and AI strategy—probably more than almost anyone in the world—and I was really
curious what those people are thinking about AI. Are they focused on it? What do they think it's
going to mean for their business? Are they building AI initiatives internally? Are they trying to
buy products from other people? What's happening?

Aon Levy: Yeah, I mean, definitely all of the above. Did you see this thing that went viral like two
weeks ago? David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, had an S1 prep. Yeah, the S1 prep. He basically had
this quote at an AI event at Cisco. They're doing projects internally where AI is writing an S1 in
like ten minutes or something, and it used to be a team of six people that worked on that, et
cetera. The exact same quote—just a parallel universe quote fifteen years ago. Let's say in the
early days of cloud, just as a useful kind of comparison, I'll probably keep coming back to the
cloud thing. It probably would have been a banking CEO saying, "We'll never go to the cloud. Like,
we don't trust the cloud. We we don't." And now the exact opposite, which happened, right? Didn't
Jamie Dimon—

Host: Jamie Dimon?

Aon Levy: Did I think he sort of evolved his thinking, but you had that kind of across the board.
These were these famous moments, as like, "We'll never be a cloud company. You know, we don't trust
it. We don't want to move." I mean, Amazon—it's a bookstore. Like, that was the refrain. And it made
sense. I mean, I even said that when I saw S3. Like, "The bookstore is going to power like, what?"
So think about how different of a world it is that the CEO of Goldman Sachs is basically saying,
like, "This is now what's possible." He wasn't saying that in like a "we shouldn't do it" way. He
was saying that in like a "we need to open our eyes, you know, up to all of the potential use cases
that AI is going to have in the business," and he was saying it as a way that they're leaning in and
starting to try out all these use cases. So for that to happen, for a top five bank in the world, at
this early in the cycle, you know, it only goes kind of, it only goes more aggressive from there.
Because he's in the most regulated of all all the businesses, in the most important financial market
in the world, and he's already leaning in.

Host: Is that because he's like a particular early adopter, or are you just seeing this across the
board where—

Aon Levy: Yeah, I mean, also, he's like a DJ, so—

Host: So maybe—

Aon Levy: Yeah, maybe he's hanging out with like EDM people that are just like really into AI music.
Okay, so, you know, ten years ago we'd host these dinners—fifteen, you know, CIOs from different
industries, heavily financial services, let's say if it's New York—and it's like, "The idea, you
know, we are going to try cloud for this one tiny part of our business. We don't really think we can
scale the idea of being cloud first is like, it would be like totally an anomaly. You would never,
like, a bank would never say they're cloud first" ten or fifteen years ago. Uh, today it is, it is
sort of like, "We're trying this in as many areas as possible." Um, everybody's still insanely early
because you've got privacy councils, compliance councils, regulatory bodies that have to look at
everything, but everybody understands how how big of a tidal wave this is going to be in their
business, um, on a few dimensions. One, they know that the workforce is going to completely change.
They I think there's a recognition that this kind of hit me maybe about a year ago in some of these
conversations. There's a recognition that basically, if you're entering the workforce today, you've
had now a couple years of ChatGPT, of, like, college—like, you don't—like, they native—it's an AI
native, you know, era of the workforce. And you know, we could make some jokes about it, maybe two
years ago, like, "Oh my God, the writing essay is I can't believe it," but like, I basically almost
don't search the internet anymore. Like, I only know how to use AI to find information. And guess
what? Like, I find ten times more information as a result of that. So so actually, in many respects,
the AI native, you know, people will be smarter on the topics that they decide to go in on, um, than
the prior generation of, of, whatever that is. So what does that mean? Like, these Fortune 500
companies are changing how they hire, or—

Host: So I don't necessarily know how they hire, but but it'll become clear that if you don't have
AI, uh, if you're not an AI first bank or media company, I strategy—literally, what is your AI
strategy? Because, because, why would, to the customers or internally, the enterprise will basically
realize that they can't actually hire the next generation. You can't go from all of a sudden I have
this AI native way of operating in college or high school to going to a company that makes me use,
you know, the equivalent of a fax machine, you know, level of technology. It's just like they won't
be able to hire people. And then their competition will have more output. They'll do more investment
banking deals. They'll onboard customers faster. They'll get better financial advice to their
clients than the company that doesn't do that. And so everybody's sort of realizing this is actually
a competitive issue. Cloud didn't really have that. Cloud was a purely an efficiency story. It was
like, "Ah, yeah, I don't really want to have to be building data centers as much. Elastic capacity
sounds pretty good. I want to be able to test this new product faster." It was not like, "My
customer is going to experience a different thing about the output of my company, whether I'm cloud
or not." Cloud now, I think we all believe that that was that there is a difference there. It was
not tangible to the buying side that cloud was going to make your company five times more
competitive in a way that AI is very clearly, I think, resonating. That actually, your company's
competition will now be at risk if you're not a native because, like, with cloud early on, a lot of
the benefits were actually to the startups who pushed it forward because they just wanted an easy
way to get set up and not have to deal with hosting.

Host: But you're saying it might be the opposite, where with AI productivity tools, startups don't
really need—actually, maybe the counterpoint to me, what this sounds like is actually way more
opportunities for startups. It's just all the office hours that we're doing. I think it's the
fastest I've seen B2B SaaS AI companies get enterprise deals. And I think you painted a very good
picture. What's the vibe shift?

Aon Levy: Yeah, if I can just flip in one funny anecdote, uh, the I went to this banking conference
eight or nine years ago, and I did this little keynote at this banking conference, and it was all
about, like, "We have to be cloud first, and enterprises have to modernize how they operate with the
cloud." And I think I've never been, I think I've never bored an audience more than that keynote.
Like, I remember getting off the stage, and nobody cared. Like, it was just like, "Cause it was
like, 'Why are you talking about backend infrastructure?' Like, nobody cares. Like, yeah, whatever,
we could be in the cloud, we could not be in the cloud, you know, at our levels of budget, if we're
spending like a five hundred million or a billion dollars a year on it, who cares if we save a
hundred million because some of it is elastic or not? Like, it's not that big of a deal." If you
were to do the same thing but an AI first to non-AI first enterprise, people would be like, "Oh,
like, actually, I probably can't run my business anymore not AI first because you would just show
people, like, 'Do you know the productivity gains of somebody using let's say Cursor?' It's like,
you will be blown out of the water competitively if you do not know how to build an AI first company
right now." And yeah.

Aon Levy: ...and so if you think about it from a market sizing perspective, the on-prem software
market was maybe 50 billion dollars and people thought, "Well, SaaS will be 50 billion dollars too."
And what actually happened was the market expanded dramatically because the unit economics got
better, because the distribution got better, because companies could now try software without
massive upfront capital expenditures. And I think we're going to see a similar dynamic with AI.

Host: So you're saying the TAM expands?

Aon Levy: Yeah, exactly. I think what's going to happen is similar to SaaS, the total addressable
market for software is going to expand significantly because AI makes software more valuable and
more accessible. You're going to have use cases that didn't exist before because now you can do
things that were economically infeasible. You can personalize at scale, you can automate things that
required human judgment before.

Host: Do you think we're in the early innings of that?

Aon Levy: I think we're incredibly early. I mean, we're probably where we were in like 2005, 2006
with cloud. Everyone's still figuring out the business models, the security models, how to actually
deploy this stuff in the enterprise. But the tailwinds are real and I think the opportunity is
enormous.

Aon Levy: It was the same size as the on-prem software company, but also the software company that's
already there is the incumbent. You know, it's like how do you squeeze out enough money to make the
business really, really interesting? And what everybody basically got wrong was it turned out that
the TAMs were probably about ten times larger. And why did the TAM grow so much? Because, just to
bore everybody, if you wanted to buy a CRM system in 1999, you had to be like, okay, I'm going to go
to the systems integrator, I'm going to get a data center, I'm going to buy a bunch of servers from
people, I'm going to install some software, I have to manage the network of that, and like you know,
lo and behold, two years later you might have a CRM system and you probably spent five to ten
million on the full project to do that. So think about who is the market that can implement a best-
in-class CRM system? It's the world's largest enterprises, you know, five thousand companies, ten
thousand companies. Salesforce comes out and they're like, for three seats online with your credit
card, you have a CRM system as good as Siebel. Obviously there'll be some nuance because it didn't
have as much functionality, but like for that company, that was as powerful as Siebel. You know,
getting started now, all of a sudden your TAM is basically every business on the planet. So you go
from a market that had maybe ten thousand customers, twenty thousand addressable customers, to now a
market that has five million, ten million potential customers. It is a totally different scale, like
you know, two, three orders of magnitude more scale that you can now go and serve.

We had a similar experience, which was the industry we were disrupting was like legacy enterprise
document management, enterprise content management systems, same exact thing as Siebel in terms of
reading the S-1 of our biggest incumbent competitor, and they were talking about like a thousand
customers or a couple thousand customers. And literally, you know, now we have one hundred fifteen
thousand. But like, at the time we had, I don't know, five or ten thousand when we started thinking
about disrupting this, and like the scale was just completely different. So that meant the market
sizes were so much larger. You know, ServiceNow today, I don't know the exact latest market cap,
maybe it's one hundred fifty, one hundred seventy-five billion. Their incumbent competitor when they
were first growing and disrupting the market today is worth maybe about five or ten billion. So if
you had looked at this company twenty years ago, you'd be like at best ServiceNow should be a five
to one billion dollar company if it just was like a better version than the current thing, and it
turns out it's fifteen times larger than what you would have thought. Salesforce did the exact same
thing.

So on AI, I think, has a similar dynamic because you're basically increasing the total spend on
software. So it's not so much that a new set of companies will buy software for the first time, but
all companies use software to do things that software didn't do before, and that will take from
budget that previously was sort of untapped, you know, from software. So the budget will be from a
variety of things, but often because now the software is doing useful work for you, you can now
afford to spend even more on that software because the alternative was a much more expensive
proposition.

Here's where I think people kind of get it wrong though. They think about it as zero sum. Well, then
all you can do is sort of take from the labor side of that spend. But it actually just turns out
most companies aren't even spending on the labor side. They're just not doing the thing. So you
know, most companies globally are not spending time to translate their advertising into a different
language. So it's not that the market for translation services is this big and we're just going to
digitize it. It's like no, a hundred times more people will do translation. You know, in our
business, like we have software now that reads your contract and pulls out the critical data from
that so you can automate a contract workflow. And like the number of people globally that are
reviewing contracts and pulling out that data, maybe it's ten thousand, fifty thousand people, I
don't know the exact number, but a very small percentage of companies are doing that with their
contracts. So they will now decide to prioritize automating a thing that they didn't automate
before.

You know, Cursor, or Replit, or Devon, or whatever, there's probably not a single dollar that's
being spent on that technology that comes from taking away from what people are currently doing.
It's purely additive because now it's expanding the use cases that software can kind of tie into. So
I think we're in for a potential scenario where the size of software now—you have to include AI in
that—could be five times larger in the next decade because it just supplies the actual underlying
work that you actually bought the software for in the first place. And that just changes everything
because now you're going to be paying for work as paying for a tool that enables other people to do
work.

Host: I think that's such a powerful AI white pill actually. It's not merely zero sum, we're
converting payroll into software revenue, and that's it. It's actually we're going to do things that
enterprises should be doing, would have been doing, never got around to, and then you know, actually
the people who are the consumers on the other end, they're going to have better products, better
services. Like the thing will actually just be better.

Aon Levy: I haven't yet read the full economic study on this, but where economists always get this
stuff wrong is, you know, they do probably by default tend to have a kind of zero sum. I mean, you
wouldn't have Jevons Paradox if economists always knew how to anticipate these things, but like what
I think they often get wrong is they look at the total amount of market labor in a category and
they're like, well shoot, if AI automates that, that's now gone. Look how many jobs that is. You
know, I think we should debate it, we should talk about it because it's a very serious thing, but
what they don't actually ever think about is the micro, the more microeconomic impact of this.

So if I'm a company, and it could be Box, or it could be a twenty person company, and I use AI to
let's say code faster, okay, well why am I coding faster? Because I'm gonna, I want to build a
better product for my customers. If I'm building a better product for my customers, my revenue
should be growing faster. If my revenue is growing faster, I probably then am hiring people to go
and do things to drive that revenue growth. Maybe it's people selling the software, maybe it's
customer support, maybe it's HR people to help scale the operation. And eventually I'll get to a
point where I say, should I reuse those dollars that helped me grow faster to hire more engineers to
grow even faster and to build more of that roadmap?

And if we were in a market that wasn't competitive, maybe you could say, you know what, I actually
just want to take the profit and be happy. But we're in a competitive market. So if you're the one
company that decides to sit on the profits that AI generated and just live off of higher profit
margin—twenty percent, thirty percent, forty percent profit margin as a company—you'll just have
somebody come into the space and say, no actually, we'll just, I'm fine to have twenty percent
profits and do that same thing, and then that company will eat into your lunch. So you actually then
reinvest those dollars back into the things that are helping you grow faster, and that's actually
like the microeconomic outcome of automation. You decide that you take that efficiency gain and you
redeploy it into the business in something that will make you more competitive or grow faster or
better serve your customers, because you're in a competitive ecosystem. And that's why I think as
you know, over time you'll yes, you'll have some displacement in different categories, but over
time, this is why it generally just looks like an upgrade to just how we tend to work, you know, in
the world. Like we just tend to use tools to work faster, to make better decisions, to build better
customer products. The customer gets a better result out of that. But we reinvest those dollars back
into the businesses because we're in competitive ecosystems. And then the ultimate winner is the
consumer. Consumer always wins on this stuff.

Host: Right. Right. Now with one X factor, just to like bring it home to SF. Like assuming we have a
regular regulatory environment where those winnings can actually turn into surplus. Right? So if it
turns out that we take those winnings and then regulate the ability to build housing, then all of a
sudden everything's still just as expensive. But like the utopian, which is sort of the abundance
thing, is like wait a second. If we could use AI to automate more, we can build more. If we could
build more, we can lower the cost of things. If we can lower the cost of things, then we can
actually lift up anybody's lifestyle. Right? Now the ten-year-old in an underserved community is now
all of a sudden has access to the world's intelligence in the form of an AI agent. So they can now
be educated better. If we can lower the cost of delivering services to people, then you get better
healthcare. That's like the ultimate utopian state is we use this automation to actually deliver
better outcomes for the world. And that will require tons of jobs as a result of that.

Aon Levy: Yep. We can be a society again.

Host: Yeah, because of AI, there you go. Aaron, thank you so much.

Aon Levy: Thank you. Thank you so much for being with us.

Host: Great. I think that's a great place to end just because, you know, to be continued. Like, you
know, I think that we're in the middle of the revolution, and the revolution does not have to be
Black Mirror. It could be something that is driven by Jevons Paradox, driven by abundance for
everyone. And that's certainly the timeline we want to be on. So let's do it.

Aon Levy: That's the future I'm betting on.
